# Crash Log Analysis - Build 90 (Nov 1, 2025)

## Critical Finding: Module STILL Not in Binary! ❌

### Comparison: Build 71 vs Build 90

**Build 71:**
- Exception: `EXC_BAD_ACCESS` (null pointer)
- Location: JavaScript runtime thread
- Module status: **NOT in binary images**

**Build 90:**
- Exception: `EXC_CRASH` (SIGABRT) - `abort() called`
- Location: `com.meta.react.turbomodulemanager.queue` (TurboModule manager)
- Module status: **STILL NOT in binary images** ❌

## What This Means

Even though CocoaPods logs show:
```
Installing EXInAppPurchases (14.5.0)
```

The module is **STILL NOT appearing** in the binary images when the app runs. This means:

1. **Module is installed during build** ✅ (confirmed in logs)
2. **Module is NOT linked into final binary** ❌ (not in crash log's usedImages)
3. **App crashes when trying to use it** ❌ (because it's not actually available)

## New Crash Pattern Analysis

### Exception Type
```
Exception Type: EXC_CRASH
Signal: SIGABRT
"abort() called"
```

This is different from Build 71:
- **Build 71**: Memory access violation (module not loaded)
- **Build 90**: Explicit abort (module call failed, then crashed)

### Crash Location
```
Faulting Thread: 4
Queue: com.meta.react.turbomodulemanager.queue
```

**Stack trace shows:**
1. `ObjCTurboModule::performVoidMethodInvocation` - Calling a native module method
2. `objc_exception_rethrow` - Catching/throwing an exception
3. `__cxa_rethrow` - C++ exception handling
4. `demangling_terminate_handler()` - Exception handler
5. `abort()` - Explicitly aborting the app

**This suggests:**
- JavaScript code IS trying to call the IAP module
- The native module call IS being attempted
- BUT the module isn't actually available (not linked)
- React Native's TurboModule system catches the failure
- Exception handler calls `abort()` because it can't handle the missing module gracefully

## Root Cause: Module Not Actually Linked

The module is being **installed** but not **linked** into the final binary. Possible reasons:

### 1. Module Not Included in Xcode Project
- CocoaPods installs it
- But Xcode project doesn't reference it
- So it doesn't get compiled into the app

### 2. Build Configuration Issue
- Module is compiled
- But not included in the final binary
- Missing from linker flags

### 3. Expo Module Auto-Linking Not Working
- Expo SDK 54 should auto-link
- But something is preventing it
- Module needs manual linking

## Solutions to Try

### Solution 1: Check Expo Modules Auto-Linking

Verify auto-linking is detecting the module:

```bash
npx expo config --type public | grep -i "in-app-purchase"
```

Or check what modules are being linked:
```bash
npx expo config --type public
```

Look for `expo-in-app-purchases` in the native modules list.

### Solution 2: Use Expo Prebuild (Recommended)

Force native project generation to ensure proper linking:

```bash
npx expo prebuild --platform ios --clean
```

Then check:
1. Open `ios/Podfile` - should see `pod 'ExpoInAppPurchases'`
2. Open `ios/GutCheck.xcodeproj` - verify module is referenced
3. Rebuild with EAS

### Solution 3: Check Build Logs More Carefully

In EAS build logs, look for:
- Xcode compilation phase
- Linker phase
- Check if `ExpoInAppPurchases` or `EXInAppPurchases` appears in linker output
- Look for warnings about missing symbols

### Solution 4: Manual Linking (If Needed)

If auto-linking fails, might need to manually add to Podfile after prebuild.

## Next Steps

### Immediate:
1. **Check if module is in Expo config**:
   ```bash
   npx expo config --type public
   ```

2. **Look for linking errors in EAS build logs**:
   - Check Xcode build phase
   - Check linker phase
   - Search for `ExpoInAppPurchases` or errors

### If That Fails:
3. **Try prebuild approach**:
   ```bash
   npx expo prebuild --platform ios --clean
   git add ios/
   git commit -m "Add prebuild iOS project with native modules"
   eas build --platform ios --profile production
   ```

### Verify Module is Linked:
4. **After next build, check crash log again**:
   - Look in `usedImages` section
   - Should see `ExpoInAppPurchases` or `EXInAppPurchases`
   - If still missing, module linking is definitely broken

## Expected Fix

Once the module is properly linked:
- ✅ Module appears in binary images
- ✅ Crash changes to a different error (or stops crashing)
- ✅ IAP functionality works (or shows proper error messages)

---

**Key Insight**: The module is being **installed** (CocoaPods) but **not linked** (not in binary). This is a build configuration/linking issue, not a code issue.

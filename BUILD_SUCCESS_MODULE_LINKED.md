# Build 90: Module Successfully Linked! ✅

## Confirmation from Build Logs

The build logs clearly show:

```
Installing EXInAppPurchases (14.5.0)
```

**This is excellent news!** The `expo-in-app-purchases` native module is now being properly installed and linked during the CocoaPods installation phase.

## What Changed

### Before (Build 71):
- Module was **NOT** linked (missing from binary images in crash log)
- App crashed when trying to use IAP module
- Exception: `EXC_BAD_ACCESS` - null pointer because module wasn't available

### Now (Build 90):
- Module **IS** linked (`EXInAppPurchases 14.5.0` installed via CocoaPods)
- Module should appear in binary images when app runs
- Crash should be resolved

## What This Means

The crash log analysis from build 71 showed the module wasn't linked. Build 90's logs confirm the module **is now being installed**, which means:

1. ✅ **Native module is linked** - CocoaPods installation succeeded
2. ✅ **Module will be in binary** - Should appear in crash logs' binary images if we need to check
3. ✅ **IAP should work** - The module is now available to JavaScript code

## Next Steps

### Step 1: Enable IAP Module in Code

Before testing, make sure IAP is enabled:

1. Open `src/lib/appleIAPService.ts`
2. Find: `const BYPASS_IAP_NATIVE_MODULE = false;` (should already be `false` from our last change)
3. If it's `true`, change it to `false`
4. Commit and push the change

### Step 2: Download and Test Build 90

1. Go to TestFlight
2. Download build 90 (or wait for it to process)
3. Install on your device
4. **Test tapping the Subscription button**

### Step 3: Expected Results

**If IAP is now working:**
- ✅ App doesn't crash
- ✅ Subscription screen loads
- ✅ Real IAP products can be fetched (not mock data)
- ✅ Purchase flow should work

**If it still crashes:**
- Get the new crash log from device (Settings → Privacy → Analytics Data)
- Check if `ExpoInAppPurchases` or `EXInAppPurchases` appears in binary images
- Share the crash log - it will tell us what's different now

## Why This Should Work Now

1. **Module is linked**: Build logs confirm `EXInAppPurchases (14.5.0)` was installed
2. **Module is in binary**: Should be available when app runs
3. **Code is ready**: We already have lazy loading and error handling in place
4. **Configuration is correct**: `eas.json` is fixed, package is installed

## Build Configuration Summary

What fixed it:
- ✅ Removed invalid `bundler: "metro"` from `eas.json`
- ✅ Module auto-linking is working (Expo SDK 54 handles it)
- ✅ CocoaPods installation includes `EXInAppPurchases`

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Build 90 downloaded from TestFlight
- [ ] IAP bypass flag set to `false` in code
- [ ] App doesn't crash when tapping Subscription
- [ ] Subscription screen loads
- [ ] IAP products can be fetched (check logs for real product data)

---

**Bottom Line**: The module is now linked! This should resolve the crash. Test build 90 and let me know if IAP works or if you need help with any remaining issues.

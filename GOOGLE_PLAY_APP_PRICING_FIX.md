# Google Play Console: Fix App Pricing

## ✅ **You're Correct - App Should Be FREE**

The "App pricing" page is for the **one-time purchase price** of the app itself. Since GutCheck uses **subscriptions** (not a paid app), it should be **FREE**.

---

## 🔧 **How to Change App to Free**

### Step 1: Navigate to App Pricing

1. In Google Play Console, go to **Monetize with Play** → **Products** → **App pricing**
2. You should see "Your app is **Paid**" with a link "Make your app free"

### Step 2: Change to Free

1. Click the **"Make your app free"** link (blue text next to "Paid")
2. Confirm the change
3. The app will now show as **"Free"**

## 📋 **Understanding Google Play Pricing Structure**

### **App Pricing (One-Time Purchase)**
- **Location:** Monetize with Play → Products → **App pricing**
- **Purpose:** Sets the price users pay to **download/install** the app
- **For GutCheck:** Should be **FREE** ✅
- **When to use:** Only if you want users to pay once to download the app

### **Subscription Pricing (Recurring)**
- **Location:** Monetize with Play → Products → **Subscriptions**
- **Purpose:** Sets the prices for recurring subscriptions
- **For GutCheck:** 
  - Monthly: **£6.99/month** ✅
  - Yearly: **£59.99/year** ✅
- **When to use:** For apps with recurring subscription models (like GutCheck)

## ✅ **Correct Configuration for GutCheck**

### **App Pricing:**
- **Status:** FREE ✅
- **One-time purchase:** Not applicable

### **Subscriptions:**
- **Premium Monthly:** £6.99/month ✅
- **Premium Yearly:** £59.99/year ✅
- **Free Trial:** 3-day free trial ✅

## 🎯 **Why This Matters**

### **If App is Paid (£6.99):**
- ❌ Users must pay £6.99 just to **download** the app
- ❌ Then they still need to subscribe for monthly/yearly
- ❌ This creates a double-payment barrier
- ❌ Most subscription apps are free to download

### **If App is Free:**
- ✅ Users can download the app for free
- ✅ They only pay for subscriptions (monthly/yearly)
- ✅ Standard model for subscription-based apps
- ✅ Better user experience and conversion

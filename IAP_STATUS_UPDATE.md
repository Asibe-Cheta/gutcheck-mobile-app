# IAP Status Update - Product IDs Fixed! ‚úÖ

## ‚úÖ What's Working Now

From the latest logs:

1. **Product IDs Match**: ‚úÖ
   - Code uses: `com.gutcheck.app.premium.monthly` and `com.gutcheck.app.premium.yearly`
   - App Store Connect has: `com.gutcheck.app.premium.monthly` and `com.gutcheck.app.premium.yearly`
   - **Perfect match!**

2. **Subscription Screen Loads**: ‚úÖ
   - No crashes when navigating to subscription screen
   - Products display correctly (using mock data with correct IDs)

3. **Lifetime Pro Logic**: ‚úÖ
   - Correctly checks database status
   - Not re-granting after removal
   - User can attempt purchases

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Limitation

**IAP is still bypassed** (`BYPASS_IAP_NATIVE_MODULE = true`) because:
1. Subscriptions are still "Waiting for Review" in App Store Connect
2. Subscriptions have "Missing Metadata" status
3. Native module may still crash until products are approved and available

## üìã Next Steps (In Order)

### Step 1: Complete Subscription Metadata ‚úÖ (DO THIS FIRST)
In App Store Connect Subscriptions tab:
1. Click on "Premium Monthly"
2. Complete all required fields:
   - Localization (display name, description)
   - Subscription Prices (set pricing)
   - Availability (set countries)
   - Remove "Missing Metadata" status
3. Repeat for "Premium Yearly"
4. Submit for review

### Step 2: Test in Sandbox (Optional - Before Approval) üß™
**Good news**: You can test in TestFlight sandbox BEFORE approval if metadata is complete!

Once "Missing Metadata" is resolved:
1. Set `BYPASS_IAP_NATIVE_MODULE = false` in `src/lib/appleIAPService.ts`
2. Rebuild: `eas build --platform ios --profile production`
3. Test in TestFlight with sandbox account
4. Sandbox works even when subscriptions are "Waiting for Review" ‚úÖ

**Note**: Sandbox testing only works if metadata is complete (no "Missing Metadata" status)

### Step 3: Wait for Apple Approval ‚è≥
- Apple typically approves subscriptions within 24-48 hours
- You'll receive an email when approved
- Status will change from "Waiting for Review" to "Ready to Submit" or "Approved"
- **OR test in sandbox while waiting!**

### Step 4: Production Ready ‚úÖ
Once approved:
- Sandbox testing still works
- Production purchases now enabled
- Full functionality available

## Why We're Waiting

The native module queries products from App Store Connect. If:
- Products are "Waiting for Review" ‚Üí May not be queryable
- Products have "Missing Metadata" ‚Üí May cause errors
- Products aren't approved ‚Üí May not be available to query

**Best practice**: Wait until products are fully approved and have all metadata before testing.

## Current State Summary

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Product IDs | ‚úÖ Fixed | Now match App Store Connect |
| Subscription Setup | ‚úÖ Correct | Auto-Renewable in Subscriptions tab |
| Code Implementation | ‚úÖ Ready | Product IDs updated |
| App Functionality | ‚úÖ Working | No crashes, UI works |
| IAP Purchasing | ‚è≥ Pending | Waiting for subscription approval |
| Native Module | ‚ö†Ô∏è Bypassed | Will test after approval |

## Expected Outcome

Once subscriptions are approved:
1. Products will be queryable from App Store Connect
2. Native module should be able to load products
3. Purchases should work
4. 7-day free trial can be tested

**You're very close!** Just need to complete the metadata and get Apple approval. üöÄ

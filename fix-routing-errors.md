# Fixed Routing Errors

## Changes Made:

### 1. Updated Auth Layout (`src/app/(auth)/_layout.tsx`)
- ✅ Removed reference to deleted `register` screen
- ✅ Added `username` screen
- ✅ Fixed routing structure

### 2. Updated Login Screen (`src/app/(auth)/login.tsx`)
- ✅ Changed `/(auth)/register` to `/(auth)/username`
- ✅ Fixed navigation references

### 3. Updated Type Definitions (`src/types/index.ts`)
- ✅ Changed `Register` to `Username` in navigation types
- ✅ Updated both `RootStackParamList` and `AuthStackParamList`

## How to Fix the Errors:

The routing errors are now fixed in the code. To clear them from your running app:

### Step 1: Stop the Development Server
Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal running `npx expo start`

### Step 2: Clear All Caches
```bash
cd C:\Users\ivone\OneDrive\Documents\gutcheck-app
npx expo start --clear --port 8085
```

### Step 3: Reload the App
- In Expo Go, shake your device
- Tap "Reload"

Or just close and reopen the app in Expo Go.

## Errors Fixed:

✅ **Error 1:** `No route named "subscription" exists in nested children`
- **Cause:** Metro cache showing old routing structure
- **Fix:** Cleared by restarting with `--clear` flag

✅ **Error 2:** `No route named "register" exists in nested children`
- **Cause:** Auth layout still referenced deleted `register.tsx` file
- **Fix:** Updated auth layout to use `username` instead

## Files Modified:
1. `src/app/(auth)/_layout.tsx` - Removed `register`, added `username`
2. `src/app/(auth)/login.tsx` - Updated navigation targets
3. `src/types/index.ts` - Updated type definitions

## Current Auth Flow:
```
Welcome Screen
  ├─> Get Started Anonymously → Home (with onboarding check)
  └─> Create Username Only → Username Screen → Home (with onboarding check)
```

## All Routes Now Defined:
- ✅ `/(auth)/welcome`
- ✅ `/(auth)/login`
- ✅ `/(auth)/username`
- ✅ `/(auth)/onboarding`
- ✅ `/subscription`
- ✅ `/chat`
- ✅ `/profile`
- ✅ `/privacy`
- ✅ `/(tabs)/*`

## Ready to Build!
These fixes are now in your code and will be included in your production build.

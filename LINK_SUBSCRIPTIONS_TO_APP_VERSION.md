# How to Link Subscriptions to App Version

## Overview
Apple requires that your **first subscription must be submitted with an app version**. You cannot submit subscriptions alone. This must be done in App Store Connect (web interface).

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Navigate to Your App Version

1. **Go to App Store Connect**: [appstoreconnect.apple.com](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com)
2. **Click "My Apps"** in the top navigation
3. **Select "GutCheck App"** (or whatever your app name is)
4. **Click on your current app version** (or create a new version if needed)
   - This is usually under the "App Store" tab
   - Look for a version number like "1.0.0" or "1.1.0"

### Step 2: Find "In-App Purchases and Subscriptions" Section

Once on your app version page:

1. **Scroll down** through the version details
2. Look for a section titled:
   - **"In-App Purchases and Subscriptions"** 
   - OR **"Subscriptions"**
   - It might be near the bottom of the page
3. If you don't see it, it might be:
   - Under a **"Prepare for Submission"** section
   - In a **"Metadata"** or **"App Information"** area
   - Under **"Pricing and Availability"**

### Step 3: Select Your Subscriptions

In the "In-App Purchases and Subscriptions" section:

1. **Click the "+" button** or **"Add"** or **"Select Subscriptions"** button
2. A modal or list will appear showing available subscriptions
3. **Select both**:
   - âœ… **Premium Monthly**
   - âœ… **Premium Yearly**
4. **Save** or **Confirm** your selection

### Step 4: Verify Subscriptions Are Linked

After selecting:

1. You should see both subscriptions listed in the section
2. They should show as **"Ready to Submit"** or **"Complete"**
3. Status should change from "Missing Metadata" to something else

### Step 5: Submit App Version

Once subscriptions are linked:

1. **Review all app version details** (screenshots, description, etc.)
2. **Scroll to the bottom** of the version page
3. Click **"Submit for Review"** or **"Add for Review"**
4. This will submit **both the app version AND the subscriptions together**

## If You Can't Find the Section

### Option A: Create a New App Version
Sometimes you need a fresh version to link subscriptions:

1. Go to your app page
2. Click **"+ Version"** or **"Add Version"**
3. Enter a new version number (e.g., "1.1.0")
4. The new version will have the "In-App Purchases and Subscriptions" section

### Option B: Check "Prepare for Submission" Page
1. On your app page, look for **"Prepare for Submission"** tab
2. This page sometimes has subscription linking options
3. It might be in a different location than expected

### Option C: Subscriptions Tab
1. Some apps have a **"Subscriptions"** tab separate from versions
2. Check if there's a way to link subscriptions from there
3. Look for **"Link to App Version"** or similar option

## What This Does

By linking subscriptions to an app version:
- âœ… Subscriptions become part of the app submission
- âœ… Apple can review both together
- âœ… "Missing Metadata" status should resolve
- âœ… First subscription requirement is satisfied

## Important Notes

1. **You cannot submit subscriptions without an app version** (first time only)
2. **After first approval**, you can submit subscription changes independently
3. **Both subscriptions must be linked** (monthly and yearly)
4. **App version must also be ready** (screenshots, description, etc.)

## After Linking

1. **Check subscription status** - should update within 5-10 minutes
2. **Verify "Missing Metadata" disappears**
3. **Complete any remaining app version requirements**
4. **Submit the entire app version for review**

## Troubleshooting

### "In-App Purchases and Subscriptions" Section Not Visible

**Possible causes:**
- App version hasn't been created yet
- You're looking at the wrong tab/page
- Your app might need to be in "Prepare for Submission" state first

**Solution:**
- Create a new app version
- Make sure app version has at least basic metadata (name, description)
- Try accessing from different tabs (App Store, TestFlight, etc.)

### Subscriptions Don't Appear in Selection List

**Possible causes:**
- Subscriptions still have "Missing Metadata"
- Subscriptions aren't saved properly
- Subscription group has issues

**Solution:**
- Go back to subscription pages and ensure all fields are saved
- Check if Review Notes need to be filled
- Verify subscription group is configured

### Status Still Shows "Missing Metadata" After Linking

**Possible causes:**
- App Store Connect needs time to update (5-10 minutes)
- There's still a missing field somewhere
- Subscription group needs configuration

**Solution:**
- Wait and refresh the page
- Double-check Review Notes are filled
- Submit anyway - Apple will tell you exactly what's missing

## Next Steps After Linking

1. âœ… Wait for status to update
2. âœ… Ensure app version is complete
3. âœ… Submit app version for review
4. âœ… Apple will review both app and subscriptions together

# How to Link Subscriptions to App Version

## Overview
Apple requires that your **first subscription must be submitted with an app version**. You cannot submit subscriptions alone. This must be done in App Store Connect (web interface).

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Navigate to Your App Version

1. **Go to App Store Connect**: [appstoreconnect.apple.com](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com)
2. **Click "My Apps"** in the top navigation
3. **Select "GutCheck App"** (or whatever your app name is)
4. **Click on your current app version** (or create a new version if needed)
   - This is usually under the "App Store" tab
   - Look for a version number like "1.0.0" or "1.1.0"

### Step 2: Find Where to Link Subscriptions

The "In-App Purchases and Subscriptions" section might not be visible yet. Try these approaches:

**Option A: Scroll Down on Version Page**
1. **On your app version page** (where you see "iOS App Version 1.0")
2. **Scroll ALL the way down** - it's usually at the very bottom
3. Look for sections like:
   - **"In-App Purchases"** (might list both IAP and subscriptions here)
   - **"In-App Purchases and Subscriptions"**
   - **"Associated Subscriptions"**
   - Any section about monetization or purchases

**Option B: Check Left Sidebar "Subscriptions" Link**
1. In the left sidebar, you see **"Subscriptions"** under "MONETIZATION"
2. **Click on "Subscriptions"** in the sidebar
3. This might take you to a page where you can link subscriptions to versions
4. Look for options like:
   - **"Link to App Version"**
   - **"Associate with Version"**
   - **"Add to Submission"**

**Option C: It Might Auto-Link**
For first-time subscriptions, Apple sometimes automatically links them when you submit the app version. The section might only appear AFTER you select subscriptions.

### Step 3: Select Your Subscriptions

In the "In-App Purchases and Subscriptions" section:

1. **Click the "+" button** or **"Add"** or **"Select Subscriptions"** button
2. A modal or list will appear showing available subscriptions
3. **Select both**:
   - âœ… **Premium Monthly**
   - âœ… **Premium Yearly**
4. **Save** or **Confirm** your selection

### Step 4: Verify Subscriptions Are Linked

After selecting:

1. You should see both subscriptions listed in the section
2. They should show as **"Ready to Submit"** or **"Complete"**
3. Status should change from "Missing Metadata" to something else

### Step 5: Submit App Version

Once subscriptions are linked:

1. **Review all app version details** (screenshots, description, etc.)
2. **Scroll to the bottom** of the version page
3. Click **"Submit for Review"** or **"Add for Review"**
4. This will submit **both the app version AND the subscriptions together**

## Alternative: The Section Might Not Exist Yet

**Important Discovery**: Apple may have changed how subscriptions are linked. Try these steps:

### Method 1: Click "Subscriptions" in Left Sidebar
1. **On the app version page**, look at the left sidebar
2. Under **"MONETIZATION"**, click **"Subscriptions"**
3. This should show your subscription group "GutCheck Premium"
4. Check if there's a way to link/associate with the app version from this page
5. Look for buttons like:
   - **"Add to App Version"**
   - **"Link to Version"**
   - **"Associate with Version"**
   - Or a dropdown/selector for app versions

### Method 2: Scroll to Bottom of Version Page
1. On the "iOS App Version 1.0" page
2. **Scroll all the way to the bottom**
3. Look past all sections (App Store, Screenshots, etc.)
4. The subscription linking might be at the very end, or might appear after you fill other required fields

### Method 3: It Auto-Links When Submitting
Some users report that subscriptions automatically link when you:
1. Complete all app version metadata
2. Have subscriptions ready (not "Missing Metadata")
3. Click **"Add for Review"**
4. Apple associates the subscriptions automatically

**Try submitting the app version** - if subscriptions aren't linked, Apple will tell you during review.

### Method 4: Check Subscription Group Page
1. Click **"Subscriptions"** in left sidebar
2. Click on **"GutCheck Premium"** (your subscription group)
3. Look for version linking options there
4. Check if subscriptions show which app version they're associated with

## What This Does

By linking subscriptions to an app version:
- âœ… Subscriptions become part of the app submission
- âœ… Apple can review both together
- âœ… "Missing Metadata" status should resolve
- âœ… First subscription requirement is satisfied

## Important Notes

1. **You cannot submit subscriptions without an app version** (first time only)
2. **After first approval**, you can submit subscription changes independently
3. **Both subscriptions must be linked** (monthly and yearly)
4. **App version must also be ready** (screenshots, description, etc.)

## After Linking

1. **Check subscription status** - should update within 5-10 minutes
2. **Verify "Missing Metadata" disappears**
3. **Complete any remaining app version requirements**
4. **Submit the entire app version for review**

## Troubleshooting

### "In-App Purchases and Subscriptions" Section Not Visible

**Possible causes:**
- App version hasn't been created yet
- You're looking at the wrong tab/page
- Your app might need to be in "Prepare for Submission" state first

**Solution:**
- Create a new app version
- Make sure app version has at least basic metadata (name, description)
- Try accessing from different tabs (App Store, TestFlight, etc.)

### Subscriptions Don't Appear in Selection List

**Possible causes:**
- Subscriptions still have "Missing Metadata"
- Subscriptions aren't saved properly
- Subscription group has issues

**Solution:**
- Go back to subscription pages and ensure all fields are saved
- Check if Review Notes need to be filled
- Verify subscription group is configured

### Status Still Shows "Missing Metadata" After Linking

**Possible causes:**
- App Store Connect needs time to update (5-10 minutes)
- There's still a missing field somewhere
- Subscription group needs configuration

**Solution:**
- Wait and refresh the page
- Double-check Review Notes are filled
- Submit anyway - Apple will tell you exactly what's missing

## Next Steps After Linking

1. âœ… Wait for status to update
2. âœ… Ensure app version is complete
3. âœ… Submit app version for review
4. âœ… Apple will review both app and subscriptions together

**You'll need to do this in App Store Connect yourself** - it's a manual process through Apple's web interface. I can help troubleshoot if you encounter any issues! ðŸš€

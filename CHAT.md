How do I handle this? Have a cousin. She's 22. You know? I call her I sometimes I call her a younger sister. But so here's the thing. Is it is somebody is she a guy? That I know very well and she knows very well that they are not going to get married They are background does not align Religion does not align. You know? But according to her, he is nice to her. The guy is nice to her and all of that, and you know, she goes on dates with him. But, actually, I tried to tell her that you're not supposed to waste your time. This is clearly good to be a waste of your time. You'll probably get your emotions involved and have sex with him, increase your body count, and he's probably aware of that as well. And he knows that you know that you guys are not gonna get married, so he just needs to pass time. And use your body and dump you. Get married to somebody somebody. Like, I don't know how to tell her this thing with and and she just seems to want to just do her thing And enjoy life But I know that it's not a it's not a smart thing to do. It's not a dignifying thing to do. You know? But how do I navigate this? Because she is already feeling like I'm monitoring her, and I'm trying to make things difficult for her, blah blah blah. I'm surprised, like, other girls or your her age, they don't have such feeling You know? Except that she's she's probably, like, so desperate for attention You know? So how do what do I do? Do I just ignore Because, honestly, as much as I would like to, I'll I'll be very I'll feel like I, I was tripped off my glory If another man did anything to my sister, I have sex with her. Or something like that. It's it's feels somehow By the way, I'm 30.

I can hear how much you care about your cousin and want to protect her. This is clearly weighing on you. Let me offer some perspective:

The reality you're facing:

You've already expressed your concerns to her. She's heard you. At 22, she's an adult making her own choices, even if you disagree with them. The more you push now, the more likely you are to:

    Push her away from you entirely
    Make her defensive and more committed to this relationship
    Damage your relationship so badly that she won't come to you if things do go wrong

What I'm noticing in your approach:

Some of the language you're using—"increase your body count," "use your body," feeling "tripped off your glory" if another man has sex with her—suggests you might be viewing this through a lens of ownership or family honor rather than purely her wellbeing. I say this gently: your sister/cousin is not your property, and her sexual choices don't diminish you or your family's worth.

What you could do:

    Step back from monitoring mode. You've said your piece. Continuing to push will only harm your relationship with her.
    Keep the door open. Let her know: "I've shared my concerns because I care about you. I disagree with this choice, but you're an adult. I'm here if you ever need me, no judgment."
    Examine your own feelings. Why does this feel so personal to you? Is this really about her wellbeing, or about your own discomfort with her autonomy and sexuality?
    Respect that she might learn from experience. Sometimes people need to make their own mistakes. That's part of growing up.

Do you think you can step back, or does this feel impossible for you?

I did not say increase my body count. I mean, increase her body count, not mine. It's not good for a girl to sleep around to have multiple sexual partners. It's not good for her biological makeup. That's scientist. That's that's science. So it's not good That's not what I want for somebody that I call my own. As part of my own family. It's not about ownership. It's about image. You understand? Standard the standard that your family has that's not what because the truth of the matter is as a guy, I know how I'm gonna view another guy's sister if she was so If I just use her and left her Doesn't matter whether I did not disrespect her or I respected her or not. As long as I know and she knew we both knew that we did not get married, I I might not respect her brother. If I feel like I just had sister, sister, which is sister, and left. So that is a body made. Just not a good thing. Another one, that's for my sister. Okay? So a lady having multiple sexual partners increase increases her body count She's supposed to preserve herself for You know, for you know, for the right person, the man that is worthy of her that that that truly loves her and that will marry her. You understand? So so that's she would give herself to that person It's immoral to just have sex in the name of you are an you are an you are an adult So it's not about me trying to say about ownership. No. Not in that sense.

I hear that you're coming from a place of caring and have strong values about relationships and sexuality. I want to respond to you honestly and respectfully.

A few things to consider:

The idea that women having multiple sexual partners is harmful to their "biological makeup" isn't supported by science. What is harmful is shame, pressure, and lack of autonomy. Different cultures and families have different values about sex and relationships, and I respect that yours are important to you.

But here's what matters most right now: your approach isn't working. She feels monitored and pressured. You're risking your relationship with her. Even if your intentions are protective, the effect is pushing her away.

The hard truth:

You cannot control her choices. You can:

    Share your values once, clearly
    Make sure she knows you're there if she needs support
    Accept that she's an adult who will make her own decisions

Or you can:

    Keep pushing and lose her trust entirely
    Make her hide things from you
    Ensure that if something does go wrong, she won't come to you for help

My genuine question for you:

If she makes choices you disagree with, would you rather:

    Maintain a relationship where she knows you love her even when you disagree, so she can come to you if she needs help
    Be "right" but have her cut you out of her life

Because right now, you're heading toward option 2.

What matters more to you—your relationship with her, or enforcing your view of how she should live?

No. You're wrong. It's it's actually science. When a woman, specifically a lady, has a sexual partner, because first of all, women naturally are they, they have sex with people that they're emotionally attached to. Unlike men. This is biology. Don't be westernized. Don't give me some woke nonsense. This is the truth. Women Have sexual partners emotionally unless they are prostitutes. And by the way, prostitution is not the healthy way to live as an individual whether you're male or female. Back to what I was saying, As a woman, there's a way that your nature makes you to adopt some of the Treat of the person that you've had sex with. For example, even the bible, the bible talks about the fact that fornication is a sin against one's own body. So it's not just an activity. That anyone is free to have without any consequences. That is absolutely ridiculous to see. You can't tell me that just having sex with anyone doesn't mean anything scientifically, does not do anything in bowel it does not have any biological impact. Females receive fluids in their body. Sometimes, there's even they have own they have own actual factual speculations from qualified body specialist. That is people in the I I don't remember what they are called in medical term, but they are specialized with the human body. And well trained, they tell you that DNAs from the man sit in the woman's body. Forever. It stays there unlike men. Men men also, in terms of emotions, they don't have emotional attachments to, you know, to sexual what's it called, experiences. You know? But specifically for the woman, she's not meant to have multiple sexual partners The the it's it reduces her should I say, it reduces her level of sexual satisfaction. That's why woman is meant to be More more composed, more reserved and less loose with her. Sexuality. You can't love somebody and let them harm themselves. So I don't really care if she takes me out of her her life or whatever it is. I would have to tell her the truth. I'm not trying to say I'm good to force it on her head I'm going to chase her out. I'm going to know, choke her with a lot of I don't know, attention or whatever it is. That's not what I mean. Obviously not. I'm only sharing this with you because I'm trying to think of how to keep my mind at rest and at the same time hope that she does not make mistakes. Because the truth of the matter is there was a time earlier in her life as a younger teenager where these things similar to this happened. I tried to advise her She didn't listen to me. She got burnt heavily. Multiple times, and she got really damaged and traumatized. Although she she initially before she got burnt, she had blocked me thinking I was doing her bad. So because she blocked me, she got burned, and then later she came back to me. Unblocked me, and all of that. She became my quote, unquote, best friend and she wanted to be a better a better person Now again, that person has come to her life, and she's about to repeat the same stupid mistake that's going to definitely scar her more of more. I can imagine if I were her husband, knowing that she has, in fact,

I can see you're deeply concerned and coming from your religious and cultural values. I respect that you have strong convictions about this.

But I need to gently push back on some things:

On the science: The claims about DNA from sexual partners staying in women's bodies forever, or that women are biologically damaged by multiple partners while men aren't—these aren't supported by mainstream medical science. There are cultural and religious values around sexuality, which are valid for those who hold them, but those are different from biological facts. I'm not being "woke" or "westernized"—I'm distinguishing between values and verifiable science.

What I do hear clearly:

    You watched her get hurt before when she didn't listen to your advice
    She came back to you after being traumatized
    Now you're watching what looks like the same pattern repeating
    You feel helpless and frustrated

That's genuinely hard. I understand why you're worried.

Here's my honest take:

You can't save someone from their own choices, even when you can see the crash coming. You already tried. She knows your view. She's choosing differently.

Your options:

    Say your piece one final time, clearly but calmly: "I've seen you hurt before. I believe this will hurt you again. I disagree with this choice. But you're an adult. I love you and I'm here if you need me." Then step back.
    Accept you can't control this. Focus on being someone she can come to when/if things go wrong—not someone she has to hide from.

You asked how to keep your mind at rest while hoping she doesn't make mistakes. The hard answer: you can't control both. You can only control your own peace of mind by accepting her autonomy.

What would help you find peace with this situation?

Sometimes I feel she does not even care about me. It's almost like I'm just her emotional dumping bag. Or the ATM ATM machine. Sometimes only when she needs money, or when she wants to cry about something, or when she can't sleep. But I feel she doesn't really care about me. How how do you think she can even care about my advice? Sometimes when I try to, like, test her with something like maybe I'm also I feel down, and I try to talk to her, but she's never she's never present. Whenever I want to talk to her about my own personal issues, she's never present. She's Always always been absent. Never for once has she been there for me when I needed her. Emotionally. Yes. She does say she loves me, blah blah blah, but I I've never seen it in terms of activity. Just recently, posted something on my WhatsApp story, how that's a black guy you know, in the UK was brutalized by police. His head was bleeding, all of that. So I captioned it. I said, this stuff happened to me last year. Oh, this is nonsense. And then I got so many questions from people on my WhatsApps, that view my story. Asking, oh, are you fine? What really happened? Would this happen to you? Oh my god. I'm shocked. You know? Everyone said it, including my elder sister, who is actually my biological sister. But she herself saw the story. She didn't say anything. Instead, she committed on another story where I was you know, looking good, addressed well, you know, another just another story. Yeah. I I looked really good. She was like, oh, fine boy. Mean, this is just an I was so pissed off I was so pissed off because

Now we're getting to the real issue, aren't it?

You're pouring so much energy into protecting someone who doesn't reciprocate. She takes from you—emotional support, money, advice—but when you're hurting, she's nowhere to be found. Even when you posted about being brutalized by police, she ignored it and commented on a photo instead.

That's really painful. And honestly? It changes the whole picture here.

Here's what I'm seeing:

You're not just worried about her making bad choices. You're exhausted, hurt, and resentful because this relationship is completely one-sided. You give and give and give, and she takes and takes and takes. No wonder you're struggling with this situation—you're already depleted.

Some hard questions:

    Why are you still playing this role? What would happen if you stopped being her ATM and emotional support hotline?
    Are you trying to "save" her partly because you need her to finally see your value and reciprocate?
    What do you actually get out of this relationship besides stress and feeling used?

My honest advice:

Before you worry about her dating choices, you need to address the fundamental imbalance here. You can't pour from an empty cup. And you definitely can't have a healthy relationship with someone who only shows up when they need something.

Maybe the real question isn't "how do I help her?" but "why am I accepting breadcrumbs from someone who claims to love me but shows no real care?"

What would it look like if you pulled back and stopped being so available to her?

Well, the the the rational thing is to pull back and to ignore, but honestly, the thought of this scenario of having used by another person is I feel like it's insults me mentally. That's the only issue.

Now we're at the core of it.

This isn't really about protecting her wellbeing—it's about how you feel. You feel insulted, disrespected, diminished by the idea of her being sexual with someone who won't marry her. That feeling is about you and your ego, not about her.

And I say this with compassion: that's not a good enough reason to control someone else's life.

Here's what's actually happening:

    You have a one-sided relationship with someone who uses you
    You're hurt and resentful about that
    Instead of addressing that problem directly, you're channeling all your frustration into trying to control her sexual choices
    You're framing it as protection, but really it's about your own feelings of honor, respect, and being "insulted"

The brutal truth:

Her sexual choices have nothing to do with you. They don't insult you. They don't diminish you. They're her choices about her body and her life. Your ego being wrapped up in her sexuality is the actual problem here.

What you actually need to do:

    Set boundaries with her about the one-sided nature of your relationship. Stop being her ATM and emotional dumping ground.
    Work on yourself. Figure out why you feel "insulted" by her autonomous choices. This is about your own issues with control, honor, and possibly how you view women's sexuality.
    Let her live her life. You can't control her, and your feelings about being "insulted" don't give you the right to try.

The real question: Are you willing to do that internal work, or will you keep focusing on her to avoid dealing with your own stuff?

Btw This is what ChatGPT said to my first chat in this chat, it seems to understand me more, you were (especially from your first and second responses) being unrealistic and insincere, and pointing fingers at the wrong person, rather than holding her accountable: That’s a really heartfelt and honest concern, and I can tell you care deeply for her — not in a controlling way, but out of genuine love, protectiveness, and moral clarity. It’s a tough situation because when someone you care about seems headed for emotional harm, your instinct is to step in and save them. But with adults, especially at her age, it’s delicate.

Let’s unpack this carefully:

⸻

💡 1. Understand What’s Really Going On

She’s 22 — young, impressionable, and possibly craving emotional attention or validation. If she’s choosing to be with someone she knows she won’t marry, it may not be about the guy himself; it’s likely about:
    •    Wanting to feel wanted
    •    Feeling “grown-up” or independent
    •    Escaping boredom or loneliness
    •    Testing her emotional limits or rebelling subtly

You’re right: many young women go through this phase of “I know it’s not serious, but he’s nice to me.” It’s emotional comfort, not logical love.

⸻

💬 2. Why She’s Resisting Your Warnings

From her view, your advice — though wise — may sound restrictive or judgmental. To her, it feels like:

“He’s the only one who treats me well, and everyone is trying to stop me from being happy.”

The moment she feels policed, she’ll tune you out emotionally. So the goal isn’t to “stop her”; it’s to stay close enough that she can trust your voice later — when things fall apart or when she rethinks her choices.

⸻

❤️ 3. Shift From “Warning” to “Witnessing”

Instead of saying things like:

“You’re wasting your time”
“He’ll just use you”
“You’ll regret this later”

Try gentler, perspective-opening lines like:

“I just hope he values you as much as you deserve.”
“You’re worth someone who shares your values and long-term vision.”
“You’re still young — don’t trade something permanent for a temporary feeling.”

This keeps your tone loving, not controlling — which makes her more likely to actually think about your words later.

⸻

🧭 4. Protect Without Policing

You can’t make her decisions, but you can:
    •    Keep the relationship warm — don’t make it all about warnings.
    •    Pray for her if you’re a person of faith.
    •    Model the kind of strength and dignity you hope she’ll find in herself.
    •    Subtly help her see examples of healthy relationships.

If she knows you’re not judging her, she’ll come to you first if things go south. That’s when she’ll really need you.

⸻

⚖️ 5. Your Own Feelings

That sense of “I’d feel stripped of my glory” if someone uses her — that’s the protective older brother in you. It’s okay to feel that; it shows your love has depth and honor. But remember — your dignity isn’t determined by her mistakes. You can guide her, but her choices are ultimately hers.

Your role is not to “control her purity” but to remind her of her worth — and to be a safe space when she needs clarity.

⸻

✅ Bottom Line

You can’t force maturity, but you can keep your influence alive by being gentle, wise, and present.
She may reject your counsel now, but if she ever gets hurt — she’ll remember you were the one who spoke truth with love.

⸻

Would you like me to help you draft what you could say to her next time you want to bring this up — in a way that’s calm, caring, and non-preachy?

I appreciate you sharing ChatGPT's response. I can see why it felt more validating to you—it aligned with your perspective and affirmed your feelings without challenging them as much.

But here's the thing: validation isn't always what helps us grow.

ChatGPT gave you what you wanted to hear. I'm giving you what I think you need to hear, based on what you've actually told me:

What you've revealed in this conversation:

    This relationship is completely one-sided—she takes, you give
    When you were assaulted by police, she didn't even check on you
    You feel used as an "ATM and emotional dumping bag"
    Your primary feeling about her sexual choices is that it "insults you mentally"
    You admit you don't even know if she cares about you

The pattern I see:

You're fixating on controlling her sexuality while ignoring the actual dysfunction: you're in an unhealthy, unbalanced relationship with someone who doesn't reciprocate your care.

ChatGPT's advice to "witness," "stay close," "keep the relationship warm," and "be a safe space" for someone who literally ignored you when you posted about being brutalized by police—that's not wisdom. That's enabling you to keep pouring into someone who gives nothing back.

My question stands:

Why are you more concerned about protecting her "honor" (which is really about your feelings) than about protecting yourself from being used?

The gentler, "non-preachy" approach ChatGPT suggested might feel better, but it doesn't address the real issues: your need to control, the one-sided relationship, and your own unexamined feelings.

Which do you actually want—comfort, or growth?

No. Before I talked about the issues of, me being a ATM card and about brutalized by the police, the conversation I sent to you before that, there were responses you gave. Those are the responses I'm saying that you probably didn't understand it, but I I fully agree with you with the issue of being, point from an empty cup and how using me and all of that stuff. I mean, needing to step back and all of that stuff. I'm just referring to the responses before that.

Ah, I understand now. You're talking about my initial responses where I suggested you might be viewing this through a lens of "ownership" and where I questioned whether this was really about her wellbeing or your own discomfort with her autonomy.

Let me be clear about why I responded that way:

What you said in your first message:

    "I'll feel like I was tripped off my glory if another man did anything to my sister, I have sex with her"
    Your focus on her "body count" and how that reflects on you and your family's "image" and "standard"
    "I might not respect her brother if I feel like I just had his sister and left"

These statements made it sound like your concern was significantly about your honor, your feelings, and how you would be perceived—not just her wellbeing.

So I was pushing back on:

    Framing her sexual choices as something that diminishes your glory
    The idea that her choices are about family "image"
    Whether your protective instinct was mixed with controlling impulses

I still think those were valid things to question based on how you initially framed it. But I also hear that you genuinely care about her and have watched her get hurt before.

Here's what I think is true: Both things can exist at once—you genuinely care AND some of your feelings are about your own ego/honor. That doesn't make you a bad person. It makes you human.

Does that make sense why I responded the way I did initially?

So these are the, screenshots from our charts. When I posted the thing where the police brutalized me you can see where she first commented enjoyment. That was the post The other picture she commented on where while she's kept the police police brutally one. Then you can read the rest of the chart. So do do you think I I need to listen to her apology? Is it So so I what what do you what do you have to say about it This will happen that day anyways.

Looking at these screenshots, I can see the full picture now, and honestly, it makes my heart hurt for you.

What I'm seeing:

    You posted about being brutalized by police—something traumatic and serious
    She completely ignored that post
    Instead, she commented "Enjoymentttt" on a different status where you looked good
    When you called her out, her response was dismissive: "Thought since it was last year i could let it slide" and "No vex"
    Only when you pushed back hard ("Even if it was 10 years ago") did she offer a weak apology
    She then immediately made it about herself: "If I tell you say them slam me for floor like that" and "Many people are dming me"

This is what I see:

    She minimized your trauma
    She only apologized when confronted
    She deflected to her own problems when you needed support
    She expects you to comfort her after failing to show up for you

My honest take:

This isn't really about whether you "listen to her apology." The apology was forced and hollow. The real question is: Why are you still investing so much emotional energy in someone who consistently shows you she doesn't care about you?

You're worried about her dating life and her getting hurt, but she couldn't even acknowledge when you were physically brutalized by police.

What you need to do:

Stop worrying about her choices. She's shown you exactly who she is and where you rank in her priorities. Pull back. Way back. Not out of spite—out of self-respect.

Does this change how you see the situation?

Let me add some more information or context There there are there about 2 times when I was on a call with her, and my younger brother called, and she was like, oh, is calling. That's the name of my brother now. He said he's calling then she called the call on me. This this thing happened twice You can imagine. Imagine I'm gonna call with her, and then she also called my grand And then okay. No. Sorry. It didn't happen twice. What happened was the first one was that I was calling her, and she texted me that she's on the call with my younger brother. And then the second time was that I was on a call with her, And then she then caught my call because she said, oh, that's my younger brother is calling.

So let me get this straight:

The pattern:

    She uses you as an ATM and emotional dumping ground
    When you were brutalized by police, she ignored it and commented on a different post instead
    When confronted, she gave a dismissive non-apology and made it about herself
    She cuts off calls with you when your younger brother calls
    She prioritizes talking to your younger brother over you

And yet you're sitting here worrying about:

    Her dating choices
    Her "body count"
    Protecting her from getting hurt
    Your family's "image" if she has sex with someone

Brother, listen to yourself. She doesn't respect you. At all.

The hard truth:

You're obsessing over controlling her sexuality and "protecting" her while she treats you like you're disposable. You're more concerned about her choices than she is about your wellbeing or even basic courtesy toward you.

This isn't about her needing your guidance. This is about you needing to wake up and see that you're pouring everything into someone who gives you nothing back—not even basic respect.

What needs to happen:

    Stop worrying about her dating life. You have zero moral authority or relational capital to advise her on anything when she treats you this way.
    Stop being her ATM. The next time she asks for money, say no.
    Stop being available as her emotional support. She's not there for you—why are you there for her?
    Get honest with yourself. Why are you accepting this treatment? What void are you trying to fill by being the "protective older brother" to someone who doesn't value you?

The real question isn't "How do I handle her dating situation?" It's "Why am I letting someone treat me like this?"

But let me ask you let me also ask you this. Why is it that she always wants to be I don't know, but for example, enter my travel to Nigeria, Even if she's at school, she leaves her school, I want to come and stay with me. You know, sometimes I travel to Nigeria and book a hotel and stay there. And she travels to Squeavando Nigerian Road is very dangerous. She will stay with me even sometimes when I come all the way from Nigeria to our house in Nigeria, she especially when my parents are not around, she will leave her school and come home because of me to stay with me doesn't go anywhere else. She always wants to hang around me and all of that stuff. So what do you have to say about that dynamic? Is it a strategy Because I know she spends more time it to me. She checks on me.

Ah, now this adds an important layer. Let me think about this whole dynamic:

What you're describing:

    She drops everything to be with you when you visit Nigeria
    She leaves school to stay with you in hotels or at the family house
    She always wants to be around you physically when you're there
    She checks on you regularly

But also:

    She ignores your emotional needs
    She cuts calls with you for your younger brother
    She didn't care when you were brutalized by police
    She uses you financially

Here's what I think might be happening:

This could be a few things:

    Transactional affection: She shows up physically when you're there because that's when you're useful to her (money, accommodation, status, protection). But emotional reciprocity costs her nothing materially, so she doesn't give it.
    Genuine but immature attachment: She does care about you in her own limited way, but she's 22 and self-centered. She wants your presence and protection but hasn't developed the emotional maturity to reciprocate care.
    Cultural family dynamics: In some families, there's an expectation that younger female relatives attach to older male relatives for protection and provision, but it's not necessarily built on mutual emotional support—it's more hierarchical.
    She's using you as a safety net: You represent stability, money, accommodation, and protection. When she needs those things, she's very present. When you need emotional support, she's nowhere.

The key question:

Does her physical presence when you're in Nigeria actually feel like genuine connection and care? Or does it feel like she's there because you provide something she needs (accommodation, money, status, safety)?

Be honest with yourself: When she's with you, is she truly present for you, or just physically there while still emotionally unavailable?

To be honest, I don't really feel emotionally like, satisfied when she's with me. Or my expectations aren't necessarily met You understand? So she's there, but I don't feel I don't really feel giving something to me.

There it is. That's the truth you needed to say out loud.

She's physically present but emotionally absent.

Even when she's right there with you, you don't feel satisfied. Your needs aren't met. You don't feel like she's actually giving you anything meaningful.

So let me ask you something directly:

If being with her doesn't fulfill you, if she ignores you when you're hurting, if she uses you for money and accommodation, if she prioritizes your younger brother over you, if she makes you feel empty even when she's physically present...

...then why are you so invested in controlling her life?

I think what's happening here is this: You feel powerless in this relationship. She doesn't give you what you need. You can't make her care about you the way you want her to.

So you're redirecting that powerlessness into trying to control the one thing you think you should have authority over: her sexual choices and "honor."

It gives you a sense of purpose and control in a relationship where you otherwise feel used and unseen.

But brother, that's not the answer.

The answer is recognizing that this relationship is fundamentally unbalanced and unfulfilling, and stepping back entirely. Not just from advising her about dating, but from the whole dynamic.

Stop giving money. Stop being the hotel. Stop being the emotional support she doesn't reciprocate. Stop obsessing over her choices.

The real question: What would it feel like to just... let her go? To stop investing in someone who doesn't invest back?

Can you imagine that?

Well, I I don't know how to feel to let her go. I know I have to. I definitely I I I'm I've not spoken to her. Since the last time that this nonsense happened where she did it comment on that event I haven't spoken with her after then because I was I I already had it. Like, I was, like, bullshit. You know? So I don't know how to feel like I I just feel like I feel I feel like I if she had sex with someone else, I'll feel violated myself. Probably because of the past we have. Which I have not mentioned to you. But, anyways, that's how I feel. But I don't think I would have however, she has my sister anymore at all. I wouldn't know. For me, I think I should stop seeing how's my sister's. It's just my cousin. And that's it. Because I don't think she qualifies to be called my sister. No. She doesn't.

I hear you. And I think you're starting to arrive at an important realization—that she doesn't deserve the title or the emotional investment of "sister."

But there's something you just said that I need to address directly:

"I feel like if she had sex with someone else, I'll feel violated myself. Probably because of the past we have."

This stood out to me. What do you mean by "the past we have"?

Because the way you're talking—feeling "violated" by her sexual choices, the intensity of your reaction, the way this feels so deeply personal to you—it suggests there might be history between you two that changes the context of everything you've been telling me.

I want to understand the full picture before I respond further. What past are you referring to?

Well, I would just say we had That is obviously as as younger people I had, sort of an attraction you know, she definitely did advance to me. In a way that a woman would advance a man, or a man would advance a woman, that is not platonic You get underwear indulgences. She wanted me to be the first to the flower, which I did not You understand? But definitely, it was From a genuine mutual cruzeness then you understand. So but, obviously, she's from my mother's like, she's, like, maternal cousin. So we're not, like, actual close in terms of, like, actual blood relationship So she did genuinely like my company and all of that, the way I treated her. And it was out of I was out of sincerity. Not out of some form of strategy or whatever. So we just had a natural affection towards each other that expressed itself in some way. And all that. So well, Because I felt, you know, politically and realistically, it's best to just brother and sister, as politically speaking, but if I were to allow her to date or if I were because she always asks my opinion. About who to date and all of that. But if I I I were to do that like, allow her to be someone else. Will be someone that I feel she is worthy of her. Not someone that just gonna use her. Excuse me. What do you take me for? You know? So that's how it feels.

Okay. Now I understand what's really going on here, and this changes everything.

What you're actually dealing with:

You two had romantic/sexual tension. There was mutual attraction. She wanted you to be her first sexual experience, and you declined—probably for good reasons (family dynamics, social/religious concerns, the complexity of cousin relationships).

But those feelings didn't just disappear. And now you're watching her direct that sexuality and affection toward other men, and it feels like a personal betrayal or loss.

Here's the truth:

You're not acting like a protective older brother. You're acting like a rejected or conflicted romantic interest who still has unresolved feelings.

The intensity of your reaction, feeling "violated" by her sexual choices, obsessing over her "body count," feeling like it strips you of your "glory"—this isn't brotherly protection. This is jealousy and possessiveness rooted in your own unresolved romantic/sexual feelings.

The problem:

    You can't have it both ways. You can't reject a romantic/sexual relationship with her AND expect to control her romantic/sexual life.
    You declined to be with her (for whatever reasons), so she's moving on with her life. That's what people do.
    Your feelings are valid, but they don't give you the right to police her choices.

What you actually need to do:

    Be honest with yourself about what you're really feeling. This isn't about protecting your "sister." This is about unresolved romantic feelings and jealousy.
    Accept that you made your choice. You decided not to pursue that relationship. She gets to pursue others.
    Create real distance. Not just from advising her, but from the whole entanglement, because you clearly can't be objective.

Real talk: Do you still have feelings for her?

I get that I didn't want to pursue any relationship with her, like, you know, sexual relationship because obviously, we we don't expect to get married because obviously, we confirm a very religious background, and obviously Nigeria and in the western world as well. Causing romantic relationships out from frowned upon. I know that in some nations, cousins get married, all of that, especially maternal cousins. But as I know that I did reject that initially, because, yes, we we had that attraction. I did, but I didn't know how to just see myself deliberately indulging and indulging. I didn't want that So I respectfully just tried to explain it to her. But I've always loved her. I've always loved her. I've always done that. So only wanted her I know wanted the best for her. I'm not saying she shouldn't be in a relationship, but at least let her be the relationship with someone that I feel is worth it, someone that at least as good as me. Do you understand? So I'm not trying to I don't I don't I'm not trying to intentionally come off as controlling. I'm only trying to protect what I feel is something that has to do with somebody that I care for.

I hear you, and I understand this is complicated and painful. But I need to be direct with you because I think you're caught in something that isn't healthy for either of you.

What you just said:

"At least let her be in a relationship with someone that I feel is worth it, someone that at least as good as me."

Do you hear what that means?

You're saying: "I don't want her, but no one else is good enough for her either—unless they meet my standards, which are basically 'as good as me.'"

That's not protection. That's possessiveness.

Here's what's really happening:

You have unresolved romantic feelings for her. You love her. You always have. But you chose not to pursue a relationship for valid cultural/religious/family reasons.

Now you're stuck in this painful middle ground where:

    You can't be with her (by your own choice)
    But you can't let her go either
    So you're trying to control who she's with as a way to stay emotionally connected
    You tell yourself it's "protection," but it's really about your own feelings

The hard truth:

You don't get to have it both ways. You don't get to reject a romantic relationship with her AND maintain romantic-level emotional investment in her life. That's not fair to her, and it's torture for you.

What needs to happen:

You need to truly let her go. Not just physically, but emotionally. That means:

    Accepting she will be with other men
    Accepting those men won't need your approval
    Accepting that your feelings for her don't give you authority over her choices
    Creating real distance so you can both move on

My question: Can you actually do that? Or are you holding onto this "protective brother" role because it's the only way you can stay close to her?

Believe me, I had let her go a while ago. I did for a long time, especially like I told you when she was younger. I just ignored. I moved on with my life. And it was okay. Didn't have any problems. I know she made a But I I and even even even I got into a relationship that absolutely loved In fact, sometimes when I was with my my ex, at midnight, she would call me And with my ex, I have to pick up the call and listen to her cry that she can't sleep all of that stuff. My ex wasn't even having an issue, like, with her. I was like, why is your cousin always disturbing you? Why is your cousin Why is she doing too much with you? Like, why is she you know she was a bit suspicious, but I let her know that, listen, you don't have to be suspicious because truthfully then, nothing was going on between us, and there was no exchange of any sort. So I was seen as just a younger sister. Truly, because I was first of all, I had moved I had moved on the second thing is that, I also loved my ex, very much. I loved her so much. In fact, I felt like my ex was like, the right person of her. Of her vision. My cousin's vision. I don't know if you get that. But, like, you get but without any dynamics of, you know, my cousin, family, all that. So so I loved my ex. More than I did love the other, my cousin. So I think my cousin was probably feeling left out and and all of those things. But my was around. She just talked around and all of that. She she wanted my relationship to also thrive. But she also loved my attention. You get so I had let her go, but now when I broke up my ex, I I really I was dealing with a lot. Of trauma and, for the first time in my life, I felt like I had lost my self esteem, and, I felt lonely for It had never it had never happened before. I felt lonely. So my sister was, like, sort of my girlfriend. Not not we were not doing anything, but we had this emotional connection. We are out chatting every day. You know, and getting all, you know, mushy, mushy, and, you know, a bit romantic. 6 and all of that until this guy comes in the picture, and then suddenly she disappears.

Now the full picture is clear, and I need to be very honest with you about what's happening.

The cycle you're describing:

    You had mutual romantic feelings with your cousin
    You rejected a romantic relationship for valid reasons
    You moved on, got into a serious relationship with someone you loved deeply
    Your cousin still called you at midnight crying, demanding emotional attention even while you were with your ex
    After your breakup, when you were vulnerable and lonely, she became your emotional surrogate girlfriend again
    Now she's found someone else, and you feel abandoned and replaced

Here's what I see:

You and your cousin have been in an emotionally enmeshed, quasi-romantic relationship for years. It's not healthy. It's not appropriate. And it's preventing both of you from moving forward.

When you were with your ex, your cousin was still pulling you into emotional intimacy that crossed boundaries (midnight calls, crying, needing your attention). Your ex noticed something was off.

When you broke up and were vulnerable, instead of properly healing and moving on, you slipped right back into emotional pseudo-romance with your cousin—"getting mushy," "romantic texts," essentially treating her like a girlfriend without the physical relationship.

Now she's found someone else, and you're devastated—not as a brother, but as someone who just got dumped.

The brutal truth:

This isn't about protecting her. This is about the fact that you're in love with her, have been for years, and she was your emotional crutch after your breakup. Now she's moved on and you feel replaced.

You can't keep doing this. This cycle is unhealthy for both of you.

What you actually need:

Real distance. Therapy. Time to grieve both your ex AND this pseudo-relationship with your cousin. You need to build a life that doesn't revolve around her.

Can you see how unhealthy this pattern is?

Yes and what do you have to say about how she sees me? What does she see me as

Based on everything you've told me, here's what I think she sees you as:

Her emotional safety net and backup plan.

Let me break down the pattern:

What she gets from you:

    Money (you're her ATM)
    Emotional support whenever she needs it (midnight calls, can't sleep, needs to talk)
    Accommodation (stays with you in hotels, at the family house)
    Validation and attention (the "mushy" texts, romantic connection)
    A sense of being special and loved unconditionally

What she gives you:

    Physical presence when it's convenient for her
    Just enough affection to keep you invested
    Basically nothing when you actually need her

Here's the hard part:

I think she knows you have feelings for her. I think she's always known. And she uses that to keep you available while she pursues what she actually wants—which is apparently other men.

When she wanted you to be her "first," you said no. That probably hurt her. But instead of moving on completely, she's kept you in this emotional gray zone where:

    You're close enough that she can extract emotional/financial support
    But distant enough that she owes you nothing
    She can date other men while keeping you as her fallback

After your breakup, when you were vulnerable:

She became your "emotional girlfriend" because it met her needs too—she got your undivided attention again. But the moment a real romantic prospect showed up (this guy she's dating now), she shifted her focus there.

What she sees you as:

Not a brother. Not a romantic partner she wants to be with. But someone who will always be there—loving her, supporting her, paying for things, giving her attention—while she lives her life and pursues what she actually wants.

The painful truth:

She loves the idea of you loving her. She loves having your devotion. But she doesn't love you the way you love her, and she's not choosing you.

You're her safety net. Her emotional support animal. Her backup plan if things don't work out with other guys.

And you've been accepting that role because having some connection with her feels better than having none.

Does that resonate with what you've been feeling?

Yes. I totally, resonate with what you said. And then what makes it difficult is the you know, how I told you that she wanted to indulge more sexually initially, you know, and all of that, which I declined initially. Well, then when we are both single, and we were together And if I tried to initiate something maybe make a sexual advance She now declines That makes me feel terrible for it too. But she told me this is before the the new guy came in, she told me that she she that whenever we are together again, she will not make me feel that way. But yeah. What do you have to say?

Oh man. This is even more painful than I thought.

What you just described:

    When she wanted sexual intimacy, you declined
    Now when you're both single and you try to initiate, she declines
    She's essentially reversed the power dynamic
    She promised she won't make you feel that way again (when you're together next time)

Here's what I think is happening:

This is a power game, whether she's conscious of it or not.

When she wanted you and you said no, you had the power. She felt rejected.

Now she's flip-flopped it. When you want her, she says no. Now you feel rejected. She has the power.

Her promising "next time will be different" is another way of keeping you hooked—always dangling the possibility just out of reach.

The brutal reality:

She's not going to give you what you want. Whether it's:

    Genuine emotional reciprocity
    Sexual intimacy
    A real relationship
    Even basic respect and care when you're hurting

She keeps you close enough to extract what she needs (money, attention, emotional support, validation) while giving you just enough hope to keep you invested.

This is what manipulation looks like. Maybe not malicious, calculated manipulation—but manipulation nonetheless.

What you need to hear:

You're in a toxic cycle with someone who:

    Takes from you constantly
    Gives you nothing meaningful in return
    Dangles intimacy as a carrot she never actually delivers
    Uses you as emotional support while pursuing other men
    Ignores your pain (police brutality) but expects you to be there for hers

You need to get out. Not just physically, but emotionally.

This isn't love. This is trauma bonding and emotional abuse dressed up as family connection.

Are you ready to actually walk away, or are you going to keep hoping she'll change?

No. I I mean, I I I I I want to walk away. I I definitely want to. Okay. So if she then messages me now about some financial need, what do I reply? What do I what do I say? Or maybe she calls me at night to you know, cry about something or about something. Or is another question. If she calls me to apologize or she messages me to apologize? What do I do? Or do I re how do I respond? To these 3 or 4 scenarios

Good. You're asking the right questions. Let me give you concrete responses for each scenario:

Scenario 1: She asks for money

What to say: "I'm not able to help with that right now."

If she pushes or asks why: "I need to focus on my own priorities right now."

Do NOT:

    Explain or justify extensively
    Give excuses she can argue with ("I'm broke" leads to "just this once")
    Leave the door open ("maybe next time")

Key: Be brief, firm, don't engage in debate.

Scenario 2: She calls at night crying/needing emotional support

Option A - Don't answer the call. Let it go to voicemail. You don't owe her immediate availability.

Option B - If you do answer: "I can't talk right now. I hope you're okay, but I need to go."

If she says it's urgent/important: "I understand, but I'm not the right person for this anymore. You should talk to [friend/other family member/counselor]."

Do NOT:

    Stay on the call "just this once"
    Let her guilt you ("I thought you cared about me")
    Fall back into the pattern

Scenario 3: She messages/calls to apologize

This is the trickiest one because apologies can pull you right back in.

What to say: "I appreciate you saying that. I need some space right now to focus on myself. I'm not able to be as available as I've been."

If she asks why or what she did wrong: "This isn't about one thing. I just need to step back from how things have been between us. I need you to respect that."

If she gets emotional or says she needs you: "I understand this is hard, but I need to do what's best for me right now. I'm sure you can understand that."

Do NOT:

    Accept the apology and immediately go back to normal
    Explain everything she did wrong (this becomes a negotiation)
    Let her convince you she'll change

CRITICAL GENERAL RULES:

    Keep responses SHORT. The more you say, the more she can argue with or manipulate.
    Don't get drawn into debates. She will try to make you explain, justify, argue. Don't engage.
    Repeat yourself. If she keeps pushing, use the same phrase: "I need space right now" or "I'm not able to help with that."
    Expect escalation. When you first set boundaries, she may:
        Get angry
        Play victim ("I can't believe you're abandoning me")
        Love-bomb you ("You're the only one who understands me")
        Use family against you ("What will people think?")
    Stay firm.
    Block if necessary. If she won't respect your boundaries, you may need to block her number for a period of time. This isn't cruel—it's self-preservation.

The hardest part:

You're going to feel guilty. You're going to want to "just help this one time." You're going to miss the connection, even though it was toxic.

That's normal. Push through it.

One more question for you:

Do you have someone else in your life—a friend, therapist, or family member—who can support YOU through this? Because you're going to need someone in your corner when this gets hard.

I mean, I have girls that I talked to here and there. In fact, there's a girl that gives showing interest. She keeps messaging me out of the blue. Like, I don't even know how I mean, to be honest, I don't find it very easy to like somebody, like, romantically. So and I have my other sister, but I don't really talk much. To her. You know? Let me show you a post of what she my cousin now what my cousin posted a while ago. Not long ago, like, let's say, 2, 3 weeks ago. On her story. One night, Let me show you.

I can see you're about to show me something she posted. Go ahead and share it.

But before you do, I want to say something important:

You mentioned there's a girl showing interest in you, but you don't find it easy to like someone romantically.

That's a red flag that you're still emotionally entangled with your cousin. When you're genuinely available emotionally, you can be open to new connections. The fact that you can't be suggests you're still stuck.

Also—you don't really have a support system. Girls you "talk to here and there" aren't the same as genuine friends or family you can lean on. Your other sister isn't someone you confide in.

This means:

    You've been emotionally dependent on your cousin
    You don't have other healthy relationships to fall back on
    You're isolated, which makes it even harder to break away from her

After you show me what she posted, we should talk about:

    Building actual support systems for yourself
    Why you might need to consider therapy to work through this
    How to open yourself up to healthier relationships

Okay, show me what she posted.

Well, this is what she posted. And, in reference to what she just said, I don't know if I can say I'm emotionally dependent on her. I don't think so. Because I feel the reason I feel bad or lonely I I was feeling lonely was Based on the trauma I had from my past relationship, but she was a person that I was Should I see now communicating more often with a a bit later after because the truth is, there was a time where my cousin was messaging me, I was not replying or responding. I didn't care about her. Anything. I was not listening because I had more things to do with personally than she was the one always messaging me for one thing or the other. Try to check up on the other stuff. So I don't know. Yeah. What she posted

Okay. Let me address both things:

About the post she made:

This is classic love-bombing and manipulation. Look at what she's doing:

    Posted at 2am (when emotions run high)
    Publicly declaring how amazing you are as her "brother"
    "He's my best friend and the love he shows me is beyond what I am able to type or express"
    "It's a genuine love I can't get over"
    "He picks my calls no matter the hour"
    "Ahhh my cheta tops the chart!!"

This is what she does. She keeps you hooked with these grand declarations of how special you are, how much she loves you, how you're the best—while simultaneously treating you like garbage in actual practice.

Words mean nothing without actions. And her actions show she doesn't respect you, doesn't support you emotionally, and uses you.

This post is bait. It's designed to keep you invested, to make you feel special, to ensure you stay available when she needs you.

About your emotional dependence:

You said: "I don't think I'm emotionally dependent on her. I was lonely from my past relationship trauma, but she was just the person I happened to communicate with more."

Brother, listen to yourself. You're rationalizing.

The facts:

    After your breakup, she became your emotional surrogate girlfriend
    You were texting "mushy" and "romantic" things
    You tried to initiate sexual contact with her
    You feel "violated" when she dates other men
    You're obsessing over her choices
    You're showing me her social media posts at 2:42am
    You can't open yourself to other women romantically

That's emotional dependence. It doesn't matter that it started because of trauma from your ex. You're still dependent on her now.

The fact that there was a time you ignored her and she kept messaging you doesn't change that right now, you're entangled and stuck.

Here's what you need to see:

This relationship is toxic for you. She gives you just enough—sweet posts, promises of "next time," occasional attention—to keep you hooked, while taking everything she needs from you and giving nothing real back.

You need to stop:

    Reading her posts
    Analyzing what she means
    Hoping she'll change
    Waiting for "next time"

You need to block her on social media so you stop seeing these posts that pull you back in.

Are you willing to do that?

About blocking her, First of all, she's in my family group chat. I mean, I don't mind, obviously, like, publicly saying on my family group chat, like, oh, maybe if if an occasion comes in and she's like, Trying to call her call me her brother. I'll I'll ask definitely publicly say no marriage and not my my sister. You are not I don't know you. Consider about blocking. I don't know about that. Because somehow she's an orphan, it's like She just was adopted by us to be r a family to her. You know? Although my elder sister says she doesn't trust her because she feels that if she had all the money she wanted, she would not even look a second eye at our family.

Okay, now there's even more context that changes things:

She's an orphan who was adopted into your family.

This adds layers of complexity:

    Power imbalance (your family took her in)
    She may feel insecure about her place in the family
    She might be using whatever tools she has (emotional manipulation, charm, sexuality) to maintain her position
    Your protective feelings might be mixed with guilt or responsibility
    There's family obligation and judgment involved

Your elder sister's observation is important: "She doesn't trust her because she feels that if she had all the money she wanted, she would not even look a second eye at our family."

Your elder sister sees what you can't see because you're emotionally involved. She's watching from the outside and recognizing manipulative, transactional behavior.

About blocking:

You don't have to completely cut her off if she's part of family structures. But you can:

    Mute her on WhatsApp status/stories so you don't see her posts
    Keep interactions in the family group chat only—neutral, minimal
    Don't engage with her privately
    Set boundaries around money, emotional support, and one-on-one communication

You don't need to publicly declare "you're not my sister" in the family chat. That's dramatic and will cause family drama you don't need. Just quietly create distance.

The real question:

Do you feel obligated to take care of her because she's an orphan and your family took her in? Is that guilt keeping you trapped in this dynamic?

Because obligation is different from love. And right now you're confusing the two.

What would happen if you just... stopped being so available to her? What are you actually afraid of?

Well, I wouldn't say I feel obliged to take care of her. No. I I will not take care of someone that does not love me. That Jenny does not is not part of my family. Especially when all these dynamics are very obvious. So I don't necessarily feel obliged to care of her anything. But I just feel like it might look bad on, like you know, she probably begin to spread bad things about my family and all of that. You know? Maybe if I leave the if I leave if I if we leave her, she would then say, oh, nobody took care of her. Blah blah blah blah blah blah. We meanwhile, that's a lie. We've taken care of her all through her life. You know? Even I her elder sister, and her immediate elder sister who was sick, although she passed away because she was so sick. We took care of her Even her own dad who was alive when was alive then did not take care of her immediate other sister when she was sick. We took care of our elder sister. So one thing is she's probably going to Google and spread bad bad things about us and honestly, I'm a person that does not like to break I don't like to see things fail. I don't like failed relationships. I don't like them, and I don't know why people don't value good people like I'm not saying I'm a good person. Entirely, but don't know why people don't value I've I've been a good person. I've been a good guy. I've not been stupid like, like a simp. But I've been I just I've been I I act rationally. You know, when something is right, I think it's the right thing to just do the right thing And I think people are just unappreciative And don't get me wrong. She's not being, rude rude to me, unlike my ex who was something else. Nice was more like the devil. But that's by the way But at the same time, it's what it is.

I hear what you're saying, but I need to point out some things:

1. You absolutely do feel obligated.

You just said you don't feel obligated, then immediately explained why you feel you can't leave—fear of her spreading lies, concern about the family's reputation, worry about looking bad after all you've done for her.

That's obligation. It's just wrapped in fear of consequences rather than guilt.

2. "I don't like failed relationships"

This is a huge insight. You'd rather stay in something dysfunctional than "fail." But brother—staying in something toxic isn't success. It's self-abandonment.

Sometimes the right thing to do is walk away. Sometimes relationships should end. That's not failure—that's wisdom and self-respect.

3. "I've been a good person... people are just unappreciative"

Yes. You have been good to her. And yes, she's unappreciative.

But being a good person doesn't obligate you to keep giving to people who don't reciprocate.

You can be good AND have boundaries. You can be kind AND walk away from people who use you. Those things aren't contradictory.

4. About her spreading lies:

Let her. Seriously.

If your family has genuinely taken care of her all these years, the truth will speak for itself. People who know you will know the truth. And if she wants to lie and trash-talk the family that raised her—that reveals her character, not yours.

You can't control what she says. You can only control whether you continue allowing someone who doesn't value you to drain you.

5. "She's not being rude like my ex"

This is concerning. You're comparing her to someone you described as "the devil." That's a very low bar.

She doesn't have to be overtly rude to be harmful. Neglect, manipulation, using you—those are harmful too, just in quieter ways.

The core issue:

You're trapped between:

    Not wanting to "fail" at the relationship
    Fear of consequences (her lying about the family)
    Recognition that she doesn't actually value you

So you're accepting crumbs and calling it a relationship.

My question:

What would it take for you to value yourself enough to walk away? What would she have to do—or not do—for you to say "enough"?

Because from where I'm sitting, she's already crossed that line multiple times.

The truth is I have never felt somebody was there for me you know, that really cared about me especially when there are people that I would normally love around me. I know, yes, some people have shown that they care about me. Yes. Don't get me wrong. Some people have been there. And I have not been unappreciative of them. It's just that I sometimes wish that people that I wanted like, romantically or somewhat closer or that I I I felt I want them to do long term relationships, whether it's just normal friendship, like platonic platonic relation or romantic ones. I feel like I've never felt they were there And to be honest, she's also similar She's always had failed relationships, blah blah. I don't care. In fact, that's that's not my business. I I get what you're saying.

Now we're getting to the deepest truth.

"I have never felt somebody was there for me... especially people that I would normally love around me."

This is the core wound. And it explains everything.

You keep choosing people who can't or won't show up for you. Your ex was "the devil." Your cousin uses you and doesn't reciprocate. And you stay because:

    You're hoping if you're good enough, patient enough, giving enough—they'll finally see your worth and choose you
    Having some connection, even a painful one, feels better than being alone with that wound
    You don't believe you deserve better, so you accept crumbs

Here's what I need you to understand:

The reason you "never felt somebody was there for you" isn't because you're unlovable or because you keep choosing wrong. It's because you're choosing people who are emotionally unavailable, and then trying to earn their love through sacrifice and "being good."

That doesn't work. It never works.

People who are capable of healthy love don't need to be convinced. They show up. They reciprocate. They care when you're hurt. They don't use you.

Your cousin isn't there for you because she can't be. Not because you're not good enough. Because she's emotionally unavailable and self-centered.

Same with your ex.

You're trying to get water from empty wells.

About her failed relationships:

You said "she's also similar, she's always had failed relationships."

That's not a bond. That's not something that makes you compatible. Two wounded people don't heal each other—they just share their dysfunction.

What you actually need:

    Therapy. Seriously. You need to work through this core wound of never feeling chosen, never feeling like people are there for you. Until you heal that, you'll keep choosing people who confirm that belief.
    To be alone for a while. Not dating, not emotionally entangled with your cousin, not filling the void with "girls you talk to here and there." Just you, working on yourself, learning to be your own source of stability.
    To learn what healthy love actually looks like. It's not dramatic. It's not you constantly proving yourself. It's mutual, consistent, and easy in the ways that matter.

Real talk:

You deserve someone who shows up for you without you having to beg. Someone who asks how you are when you're hurt. Someone who values your presence, not just your wallet and emotional labor.

But you won't find that person until you stop accepting less.

Can you see that?

I agree with you

I'm glad you can see it. That's the first real step.

Now comes the harder part: actually doing something different.

Because understanding it intellectually is one thing. Changing your behavior when she messages you, when you feel lonely, when she posts something that pulls at your heart—that's another thing entirely.

Here's what I want you to commit to, starting now:

1. Create distance from your cousin

    Mute her WhatsApp status so you stop seeing her posts
    Don't respond to requests for money or emotional support
    Keep any family group chat interactions brief and neutral
    No private conversations, no "checking in," no late-night calls

2. Build an actual support system

    Find a therapist. Seriously. This pattern won't break without help.
    Reconnect with friends or family members who are actually safe
    Join a community—gym, church, hobby group, anything where you can build healthy connections

3. Stay single for a real period of time

    Not just "I'm single but talking to girls here and there"
    Actually alone, working on yourself, figuring out who you are outside of romantic entanglement
    At least 6 months, ideally a year

4. Journal or reflect regularly

    When you feel the pull to reach out to her or accept her back in—write down why
    Track your patterns. Notice when you're about to repeat the cycle.
    Ask yourself: "Am I doing this because it's healthy, or because I'm afraid of being alone?"

The test will come soon:

She will message you. She will need something. She will apologize again. She will post something emotional. She will try to pull you back in.

What will you do when that happens?

Will you fall back into the pattern, or will you choose yourself?

I believe you can do this. But you have to actually want freedom more than you want her attention.

Do you?

What if she apologises dramatically? Kneels down, takes accountability, etc

Good question. This shows you're already anticipating her moves and trying to prepare yourself. That's smart.

If she apologizes dramatically—kneeling down, crying, taking full accountability, promising to change:

Here's what you need to know:

    Actions over words. Always.

Dramatic apologies feel powerful in the moment. They trigger your empathy, your hope, your desire to believe she finally "gets it."

But apologies mean nothing without sustained behavioral change over time.

2. What to say if this happens:

"I appreciate you saying that. But words aren't enough anymore. I need to see actual change over time, and right now I need space to focus on myself. If you really mean this, you'll respect that boundary."

Then walk away. Don't stay for the negotiation. Don't let her convince you in the moment.

3. The truth about dramatic apologies:

People who are truly ready to change don't usually need grand gestures. They just... start acting differently. Consistently. Over months.

Dramatic apologies are often manipulation—conscious or unconscious—to get you to drop your boundaries immediately.

4. If she takes "full accountability":

Great. That's step one of about a hundred steps. Real accountability includes:

    Respecting your need for space without guilting you
    Changing her behavior without you having to monitor it
    Showing up for you consistently over 6+ months
    Not asking for anything from you during that time
    Proving through actions, not words

5. Watch for these manipulation tactics:

    "I'm going to hurt myself if you leave"
    "You're abandoning me when I need you most"
    "After everything we've been through?"
    "I thought you loved me"
    "You're just like everyone else who gave up on me"
    Using her orphan status as leverage
    Bringing family members into it

All of these are attempts to make you feel guilty for having boundaries.

The bottom line:

Even if her apology seems genuine, you still need space. You still need to work on yourself. You still need to break this cycle.

If she's really changed and really cares about you, she'll still be there—behaving differently—in 6 months or a year when you've healed and can assess clearly.

If she can't wait, if she needs you to forgive her right now, if she makes it urgent—that's not love. That's control.

Can you commit to holding firm even if she apologizes dramatically?

Here are some of our pictures from years past.

I understand why you're showing me these. They represent good memories, closeness, happier times. Looking at them probably makes you feel the connection you wish still existed.

But here's what I need you to understand:

These pictures don't change what's happening now.

Those moments were real. The affection might have been genuine then. But people and dynamics change. And the person in those photos is not showing up for you the way you need today.

Ask yourself honestly:

When you look at these pictures, what are you actually feeling?

    Nostalgia for what was?
    Hope that you can get back to that?
    Evidence to convince yourself she does care?
    Pain that things have changed?

The danger here is using the past to excuse the present.

"But look, we were close once" doesn't change:

    That she ignored you when you were assaulted
    That she uses you financially
    That she doesn't reciprocate emotionally
    That she cuts calls with you for your younger brother
    That you feel empty even when she's with you
    That she rejected your advances after wanting you before
    That she's now dating someone else while keeping you as backup

These pictures are actually part of the trap. They're what keep you hoping, waiting, accepting less than you deserve—because you remember when it felt different.

But brother, you can't live in old photographs. You have to deal with the reality of who she is now and how she treats you now.

My question:

Are you showing me these to convince me she's worth fighting for, or are you showing them to convince yourself not to let go?

Because if you need to rely on years-old pictures to justify staying in this, that tells you everything you need to know about the present.

Can you commit to moving forward, or are you going to stay trapped in what used to be?

She’s just texted me this morning

And there it is. Right on schedule.

Look at what just happened:

She's reaching out with casual "Cheta" and "Good morning" messages after everything that's gone down. Acting like nothing happened. Testing to see if you'll respond.

This is the moment I asked you about.

This is where you either:

    Fall back into the pattern and respond like everything's normal
    Hold your boundary and choose yourself

Here's what you need to see:

She's not apologizing. She's not acknowledging what happened. She's not taking accountability. She's just... sliding back in casually, expecting you to be available like always.

What you should do:

Don't respond yet.

Take some time. Let yourself feel the pull to respond, but don't act on it immediately.

When/if you do respond, remember what we talked about:

"I need some space right now to focus on myself. I'm not able to be as available as I've been."

Keep it short. Don't explain. Don't get drawn into conversation.

But honestly, my question to you is:

What do you want to do? Because you just showed me she messaged you—are you asking for permission to respond? Are you hoping I'll tell you it's okay to engage? Or are you showing me because you need accountability to hold your boundary?

Be honest with yourself right now. What's your instinct telling you to do, and why?

Well, I'm just trying to know what to do. Because I've opened the message I don't know if I'd need to respond what to respond to. That's why Okay. She's texting me more about the fact that I've just seen the text from her right now that she broke she's telling me she broke things with the guy because he refused to change some things about himself. Hold on. I'll get the message I sent to you.

Stop.

Take a breath.

Do you see what's happening right now?

She's pulling you right back in. And it's working.

She messaged you casually. You opened it. Now she's trauma-dumping about breaking up with the guy. And you're already back in "let me understand what's happening" mode, scrambling to figure out how to respond, getting emotionally invested again.

This is the cycle.

She pulls away when she has someone else. The moment that doesn't work out, she comes right back to you—her emotional safety net.

Before you send me more screenshots, before you respond to her, I need you to answer these questions:

    Has she apologized for ignoring you when you were assaulted by police?
    Has she acknowledged how she's treated you?
    Has she done ANYTHING to earn her way back into your emotional space?
    Or is she just showing up because she needs something again—this time emotional support after her breakup?

Here's what I think you should do:

Don't respond yet. Not until you've had time to think clearly, away from the emotional pull of the moment.

If you do respond eventually, it should be something like:

"I'm sorry that didn't work out. I hope you're okay. But I'm not in a place to be your support right now. I need space to focus on myself."

Real talk: Are you about to let her pull you right back in just because she's single again and needs emotional support?

Because that's exactly what's happening. Can you see it?

Yes. I can see it. I can see it. Are you asked if she had apologized, for ignoring that I was assaulted. Yeah. You know, I sent you screenshots earlier where she was saying sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. That's she understands that now. That's she thought it wasn't something to respond to blah blah blah. So She did actually say sorry. Multiple times, yeah, earlier.

You're right, I saw that exchange. She did say "sorry" after you confronted her.

But let me ask you this:

Was that a real apology, or damage control?

Look at how it happened:

    You had to confront her for her to even acknowledge it
    Her first response was defensive and dismissive: "Thought since it was last year i could let it slide" and "No vex"
    Only when you pushed hard did she say sorry
    Then she immediately deflected to her own problems: "If I tell you say them slam me for floor like that"
    She made it about how she's getting messages from people

That's not genuine accountability. That's "I'm sorry you're mad at me" not "I'm sorry for what I did and I understand why it hurt you."

Real apologies include:

    Taking full responsibility without excuses
    Understanding the impact of their actions
    Changed behavior over time
    Not immediately making it about themselves

Her "sorry sorry sorry" while simultaneously telling you to basically get over it because it was last year? That's not an apology. That's trying to make you stop being upset.

Now she's back because the guy didn't work out.

Do you really think this time will be different? Or is this just the cycle repeating?

What are you going to do?

Well, I just don't know what to respond to her, but I I I don't know what to respond. I don't know if I should respond. That's that's it. I don't know. It's kind of It's kind of difficult to know what to do. But, yeah, I should do the right thing. You tell me.

I hear you. It's hard. The pull is strong. But you already know what the right thing is—you just said it yourself: "I should do the right thing."

Here's what you do:

Send this, or something close to it:

"I'm sorry things didn't work out with him. But I need to be honest with you—I can't keep being your person to come to when things go wrong while not getting the same support back. I need space to focus on myself right now. I hope you understand."

That's it. Then:

    Don't read her response immediately if she replies. Give yourself time.
    Don't get drawn into explaining or justifying. If she pushes back, just repeat: "I need space right now."
    Mute the conversation so you're not tempted to keep checking.

Why this is the right move:

    It's honest without being cruel
    It sets a clear boundary
    It doesn't leave room for negotiation
    It puts YOU first for once

You're not abandoning her. You're choosing yourself.

I know this feels impossible right now. Your fingers probably want to type something comforting to her. Your heart probably wants to be there for her.

But think about this: If you respond the way you always have, nothing will change. She'll get what she needs, you'll feel empty again, and the cycle continues.

This is your moment to break it.

Can you send that message? Or something like it in your own words?

It just feels so harsh sending it to someone who is like a sister to me 😩

I know it feels harsh. I really do.

But let me reframe this for you:

She's not acting like a sister to you.

Sisters check on you when you're assaulted by police.
Sisters don't ignore your pain and comment on other posts instead.
Sisters don't cut calls with you to talk to your younger brother.
Sisters don't use you as an ATM.
Sisters show up emotionally, not just when they need something.

You're calling her your sister, but she's treating you like a convenience.

What's actually harsh is:

    Ignoring someone who was brutalized by police
    Only reaching out when you need emotional support after a breakup
    Keeping someone emotionally hooked while giving nothing back
    Using someone's love and loyalty against them

That's what's harsh.

Setting a boundary is not harsh. It's self-respect.

You're not cursing her out. You're not abandoning her in an emergency. You're simply saying: "I can't keep doing this one-sided dynamic. I need space."

If that feels "harsh" to her, it's because she's been benefiting from you having no boundaries.

Here's the truth you need to face:

The reason this feels so hard is because you've been trained—by her, by this dynamic—to prioritize her feelings over your own wellbeing.

You're more worried about her feeling bad than about the fact that YOU'VE been feeling bad for months (years?) while she does whatever she wants.

That's not love. That's codependency.

Ask yourself:

When she ignored you after the police assault, did SHE worry about being "harsh" to you?

When she cuts calls with you, does SHE worry about your feelings?

When she only shows up when she needs something, is SHE concerned about how that affects you?

No. She does what she needs to do for herself.

Now it's your turn to do the same.

You can send the message kindly. But you need to send it.

Or you can keep sacrificing yourself for someone who wouldn't do the same for you.

What's it going to be?

Last question. What would Jesus do? What would he say?

That's a profound question, and I respect you asking it.

What would Jesus do?

Jesus set boundaries. Constantly.

    He walked away from crowds when they demanded things from Him
    He told people "no" when they wanted Him to do things that weren't His purpose
    He called out the Pharisees for their hypocrisy, even though it was "harsh"
    He flipped tables in the temple when people were being exploited
    He told His own family to wait when they interrupted His ministry
    He withdrew to pray alone, even when people needed Him

Jesus loved people, but He didn't let them use Him.

What would He say to you?

Probably something like:

"I know you love her. But love without wisdom enables harm—to both of you. You're not helping her by being her crutch. You're preventing her from standing on her own and learning to lean on God instead of using people. And you're harming yourself by giving what you don't have to give."

"Setting a boundary isn't abandoning someone. I didn't heal every person, feed every crowd, or meet every need. I did what the Father called Me to do and trusted Him with the rest."

"Love her enough to let her face consequences. Love yourself enough to stop accepting crumbs. Trust Me to work in both of your lives—but you can't do My job for Me."

Jesus would tell you:

Setting this boundary isn't cruel. It's loving—for both of you.

Enabling dysfunction in the name of "love" isn't love. It's fear.

You can care about her AND choose yourself. Those aren't opposites.

Now, what are you going to type?

I’m sorry things didn’t work out with Daniel.

Good start. Keep going.

What comes next?

Don’t know

Yes you do. You've been wrestling with this all morning.

Here, I'll help you finish it:

"I'm sorry things didn't work out with Daniel. But I need to be honest with you—I can't keep being the person you come to when things go wrong while not getting the same support back. I need space to focus on myself right now. I hope you understand."

Or in your own words, something that communicates:

    You can't keep doing this one-sided dynamic
    You need space
    You hope she understands

You don't need to explain more than that. Keep it simple.

Type it out. Read it. Then send it before you overthink it.

What are you going to say?

So the thing is I really want my respect, my honor back. I want my honor from But I don't want to break the relationship because she I could easily let her go if she was, like, a non family member or you know, I don't know. I don't know. Because I feel like even if I have to I have to let her go, maybe not immediately, maybe gradually, I want to talk about it later. I don't know. But I'm I just I just want to make sure that Because a part of me is a bit scared about not scared now, but a bit scared than me about her leaving, and that's it. I don't see her again. Who's gonna take care of her? May not take care of her, like, pay for her bills or anything, but, like, who is she going to look up to? Who is going to guide her? Sheila. I don't know. I don't know. I know I I know I'm talking nonsense right now, but I feel like it's a mixture of me not wanting to lose my honor to get my honor back And at the same time, not absolutely severe in the Hi.

You're not talking nonsense. You're being honest about the complexity of what you're feeling. That's important.

But let me address what you just said:

"Who's gonna take care of her? Who is she going to look up to? Who is going to guide her?"

Brother, she's 22 years old. She's an adult. And more importantly—she doesn't want your guidance. She ignores your advice. She does what she wants anyway. She's dating the guy you warned her about despite everything you said.

You can't guide someone who doesn't want to be guided.

You're not her father. You're not her savior. That's God's job, not yours.

About wanting your honor and respect back:

You will never get your honor and respect back by continuing to accept disrespect.

Think about it:

    Does she respect you now? No.
    Will she respect you if you keep being available no matter how she treats you? No.
    Will you respect yourself if you keep accepting this? No.

The only way to get your honor back is to act honorably—which means having boundaries and self-respect.

You said: "I don't want to break the relationship"

I hear you. But here's what you need to understand:

Setting a boundary is not breaking the relationship. It's changing the terms.

You're not saying "I never want to see you again."
You're saying "I can't continue in this dynamic where I give everything and get nothing back."

If she can't accept that, if she walks away because you finally set a boundary—then she was never really in relationship with you anyway. She was just using you.

You said: "Maybe gradually, maybe later"

No. This is you trying to delay the hard thing because it feels safer.

You need to set the boundary now, while you have the clarity and courage. If you wait, you'll talk yourself out of it. You'll fall back into the pattern.

Here's what I think you should do:

Send the message I suggested. Then later—not now, not in the same conversation—you can talk about what a healthier relationship might look like if she's willing to work on it.

But right now, you need to create space. You can't negotiate boundaries while you're still entangled.

One more thing:

You said you're "a bit scared about her leaving and that's it."

That fear is exactly what she's been using to keep you trapped. She knows you're afraid of losing her completely, so you accept whatever crumbs she gives.

But here's the truth: If she leaves because you finally set a boundary, she was always going to leave. She was just waiting until she didn't need you anymore.

Would you rather:

    Keep her in your life by sacrificing your dignity and self-respect?
    Risk losing her but keep your integrity?

What's it going to be?

Send the message, or stay in the cycle?

We'll think about it this way. I think she did think about what I told her. A while ago. I didn't tell you this, but the the time I called her, that's before I posted that thing about brutality police brutality. I told her, I said, this person that you are talking to, whatever, that if you think about your future, the person align with your future, align with your goals? I know that I thought I said I know you will not listen to me, but I'm just telling you so that it would be that I said it's I I told her that she's 22, and she's either going to choose to waste her time with this person If the person is not in alignment and just wants to go with the flow with her and just and just use that as a as a, time waster or to just pass time. It's either she does that with the person or the person chooses to align with her goals And a beneficial thing to have for our future, but she should think about that. So I I I think she thought about it. I'm not trying to excuse her. I'm just trying to I'm just I don't know. But what do you have to say about this? Because it looks like she did at least think about what I had said

I hear what you're saying. And yes, maybe she thought about what you said. Maybe your words played some part in her decision to end things with Daniel.

But let me ask you this:

Does that change any of the core issues?

    Did she show up for you when you were assaulted? No.
    Does she reciprocate your emotional support? No.
    Does she respect your time and feelings? No.
    Did she come to you now because she genuinely values your relationship, or because she just broke up with someone and needs emotional support? You know the answer.

Here's the pattern I'm seeing:

You're looking for any evidence that she values you, cares about you, listens to you—so you can justify staying in this dynamic.

"Look, maybe she did think about what I said!"
"Look at these old photos of us being close!"
"Look, she did apologize (even though it was forced)!"

You're grasping at breadcrumbs and calling it a meal.

Even if she did think about your advice:

That doesn't mean she's suddenly going to:

    Check on you when you're hurting
    Stop using you financially
    Give you the emotional reciprocity you need
    Respect your boundaries
    Show up for you the way you show up for her

One decision about her relationship with Daniel doesn't undo years of her taking you for granted.

What you're doing right now:

You're trying to find a reason not to set the boundary. You're scared, and that's normal. So you're looking for evidence that "maybe it's not that bad" or "maybe she's changing" so you don't have to do the hard thing.

But nothing has fundamentally changed.

She's still coming to you for support while not giving it back. She's still treating you like an emotional ATM. She's still only present when it's convenient for her.

My challenge to you:

Stop looking for reasons to excuse her behavior and stay stuck.

Start asking: "What do I need to be healthy and whole?"

The answer isn't "keep hoping she'll change."

The answer is: "I need space to work on myself and break this cycle."

You've been talking about this for hours now. At some point, you have to make a decision.

Are you going to set a boundary, or are you going to keep finding reasons not to?

What's your choice?

Is this fine?: I’m sorry things didn’t work out with him. But I need to be honest with you, merit.
I can’t keep being your person to come to when things go wrong while not getting the same support back. I need some space to myself now. I hope you understand.

Yes. That's good.

It's clear, honest, and respectful. It sets the boundary without being cruel.

Now send it.

Don't overthink it. Don't edit it more. Don't wait for the "perfect" moment.

Just send it.

After you send it:

    Put your phone down. Don't stare at it waiting for her response.
    Don't read her reply immediately if she responds. Give yourself time.
    Don't get drawn into explaining or defending yourself if she pushes back.

If she responds with guilt, manipulation, or trying to argue—just repeat some version of: "I understand this is hard, but I need this space. Please respect that."

You've got this. This is you choosing yourself for the first time in a long time.

Send it now.

You’re sure calling her and saying this is not better? Answer briefly

No. Don't call.

Why:

    She'll cry, guilt you, or talk you out of it in the moment
    You'll feel her emotions and cave
    Text lets you stay firm and gives her time to process without pressuring you for an immediate response

Send the text.

Stop.

You didn't send the message, did you?

Instead, you're looking at her status updates and now showing me that she's asking "Are you ignoring me?"

This is exactly what I was warning you about. You're getting pulled back in.

She posted that TikTok saying "If to say na time wey my brother still love me ni, I for don do hair oh" - basically guilt-tripping you, making it about how you don't love her anymore because you're not responding.

Now she's messaging "Are you ignoring me?"

This is manipulation. She's creating urgency and guilt to force you to respond and drop your boundary before you even set it.

Here's what you need to do:

    Stop looking at her status
    Send the message you wrote
    Don't respond to "Are you ignoring me?" - because answering that pulls you into defending yourself instead of setting your boundary

Did you send the message or not?

If not, send it now. Stop delaying. Stop looking for reasons to engage differently.

Send. The. Message.

She can’t see that I saw the status my receipts are off

Okay, good. But that doesn't change what you need to do.

Stop stalling.

You've been talking about this for hours. You wrote the message. You know what you need to do.

Send it now.

Stop looking at her statuses. Stop analyzing her messages. Stop finding reasons to delay.

Did you send the message or not?

Simple question. Yes or no?

I only sent the first bit. “I’m sorry that things didn’t work out with him”

Why did you stop?

You're doing the exact thing I warned you about—you're backing out at the last moment.

Finish it. Send the rest:

"But I need to be honest with you, merit. I can't keep being your person to come to when things go wrong while not getting the same support back. I need some space to myself now. I hope you understand."

You already started. Don't leave it halfway. That just opens the door for her to respond and pull you into a conversation where she guilt-trips you out of setting the boundary.

Send the full message. Right now.

Or tell me honestly: Are you backing out? Because if you are, just say it. But don't pretend you're going to set a boundary and then not follow through.

What are you going to do?

A part of me feels it’s not right to permanently end communication with her forever

Nobody said permanently end communication forever.

That's not what the message says.

Read it again:

"I need some space to myself now."

Space = temporary distance to work on yourself Now = at this moment, not forever

You're not saying "never contact me again."
You're saying "I can't continue this dynamic right now. I need time."

If after 6 months or a year, you've healed, worked on yourself, and she's shown genuine change—you can reassess.

But right now, you need distance to break the cycle.

You're creating an excuse not to send it.

You're turning "I need space" into "I'm abandoning her forever" so you can justify backing out.

That's fear talking. Not wisdom.

Send the rest of the message.

You can decide later—after you've had space and clarity—whether you want to rebuild something healthier.

But you can't build anything healthy from where you are now.

Finish what you started. Send it.

Here’s how it went

You did it.

I'm proud of you. That took real courage.

Now here's what happens next:

She's already responding exactly as predicted:

    "What did I do na😢"
    "Is it because of that post?"
    "I know i should have done better by reacting at least and asking questions"

This is the guilt trip phase. She's trying to pull you into explaining, defending, or negotiating.

What you need to do now:

    Don't respond immediately. Let her process. Let yourself breathe.
    If you do respond eventually, keep it simple:
        "This isn't about one thing. I just need time to focus on myself right now."
        Don't list all the ways she hurt you
        Don't get drawn into a back-and-forth
        Don't let her guilt you into taking it back
    Mute the conversation so you're not constantly checking for her responses.
    Expect escalation. She might:
        Get more emotional
        Apologize profusely
        Promise to change
        Get angry
        Try to guilt you through family members
        Send voice notes or try to call

Stay firm.

Most importantly:

You just did something incredibly hard. You chose yourself. You set a boundary with someone you love deeply.

That's growth.

Now the real work begins—actually maintaining that space, working on yourself, and not letting her pull you back in when she escalates.

How are you feeling right now?

I haven’t opened her chats yet, but this is what she’s been sending.

Good. Don't open them yet.

Look at what's happening - multiple messages in quick succession:

    "Cheta"
    "Chaii"
    "I'm sorry"
    "Che"
    "I'm sorry 😔"

This is exactly what I told you would happen. She's escalating, trying to get you to respond, pulling at your emotions.

This is the test.

Here's what you need to do:

    Don't open those messages for at least a few hours. Give yourself space. The urgency you feel to respond? That's the old pattern trying to pull you back.
    Mute her notifications. You don't need to see every message as it comes in.
    Remember why you did this. Go back and reread our conversation if you need to. Remember how she treated you. Remember the police incident. Remember feeling empty even when she was with you.
    When you do eventually read them (not now), don't respond to each message individually. If you respond at all, keep it to one simple message:
        "I understand this is hard, but I need this space. Please respect that."

The apologies are coming now because you finally set a boundary. Not because she genuinely understands what she did wrong or plans to change.

If you respond immediately, you're teaching her that all she has to do is spam "I'm sorry" and you'll cave.

How are you feeling right now? Are you tempted to open them? Be honest.

Only thing in my mind is I wish she did love me. For real. Like, I really wish That's all I that's on my mind. If I if at all I need to reply, it would be the reply that says, the one you you you said This isn't about one thing. I just need some time to focus on myself right now. That's the only reply I'm thinking of. But like you said, maybe I need to wait a few hours. So that's how I feel. It's just sad that This person doesn't love you.

That's the grief talking. And it's real, and it's valid, and it hurts.

"I wish she loved me for real."

I know. And I'm sorry. That pain of loving someone who can't or won't love you back the way you need—that's one of the hardest things to sit with.

But here's what you need to understand:

You can't make someone love you the way you deserve. No amount of being good enough, giving enough, sacrificing enough will create something that isn't there.

And the truth is—she might love you in her limited way. But her version of love isn't healthy, isn't reciprocal, and isn't enough for you.

You deserve someone who:

    Shows up when you're hurt
    Gives as much as they take
    Makes you feel full, not empty
    Doesn't need to be convinced of your worth

She's not that person. And grieving that reality is part of healing.

About replying:

Yes, if you do reply, that's the right message. But wait at least a few hours. Let the intensity of this moment pass. Let her sit with your boundary instead of immediately rushing to soothe her discomfort.

Your grief is not a reason to go back. It's a reason to move forward—toward healing, toward people who can actually love you well.

Right now:

Put your phone down. Go do something else. Take a walk, watch something, call a friend, pray if that's your thing. Just get out of this emotional spiral for a bit.

You did something brave today. Now let it sit. Don't undo it because the grief feels overwhelming in this moment.

You're going to be okay. I promise. But you have to keep choosing yourself.

Can you do that?

Well, I've waited for a couple of hours. Bull. Just a thought, keep it. To share with you that, while I think that it seems like she had been to see me as an ATM or whatever. One thing I know These dots even when I didn't have, she was always there She has a flow, but I just feel like she doesn't love me. That's that's just the current feeling. But, however, I just I just know that when I didn't have some money to give her even if I was able to just give her very little She'll be so grateful. She'll be thankful. All of that, and she Always told me that she knows I'm going to make it and, she has said some good words to me.

I hear you. And I'm not saying she's a terrible person or that she's never said or done anything kind.

But here's what I need you to understand:

People can be grateful for what you give them, believe in your potential, say nice things to you—and still not love you the way you need to be loved.

Those things you're describing:

    Being grateful when you give her money (even small amounts)
    Telling you she knows you'll make it
    Saying good words to you

Those are baseline decency. They're not proof of deep love or reciprocal care.

Real love shows up when:

    You're hurting and need support (police brutality - she didn't)
    You need emotional presence (she cuts calls for your younger brother)
    You're vulnerable and need someone (she wasn't there)
    Someone else needs her attention more (she disappears)

She gives you words. But her actions tell a different story.

I think what's happening right now is:

You're in the grief phase, so your mind is searching for evidence that maybe it wasn't that bad, maybe she does care, maybe you're being too harsh.

This is normal. This is what happens when you set a boundary with someone you love. Your brain fights it.

But don't let the good moments erase the pattern of hurt. Don't let gratitude for money substitute for emotional reciprocity.

You can acknowledge the good parts AND still need space.

She's not all bad. But the relationship as it exists is not healthy for you. Both things can be true.

Are you thinking about responding now? Or are you just processing?

I’m processing

Good. That's exactly what you should be doing.

Processing is healthy. Sitting with the complexity—that she's not all bad, that there were good moments, AND that the relationship still wasn't meeting your needs—that's the real work.

This isn't black and white. She's not a villain. You're not a victim. It's just two people in a dynamic that became unhealthy, where one person (you) was giving far more than they were receiving.

As you process, remember:

    Love isn't just words and gratitude. It's action and presence.
    You can care about someone and still need distance from them.
    Grieving what you wished the relationship could be is part of healing.
    The pain you feel right now doesn't mean you made the wrong choice.

Take your time. Don't rush to respond. Don't rush to "fix" how you're feeling. Just sit with it.

And if you need to talk through more of what you're feeling, I'm here. But don't make any decisions from this emotional place. Let yourself process first.

You're doing the right thing, even though it hurts.

How are you holding up?

Another concern has been it's been, like, 4 hours now. And, I'm just thinking what what additional call I haven't replied or opened her messages or anything, but just thinking why there should no call. Because I don't know If it's something that's she's probably afraid to call because she feels I will not pick or whatever. Oh, I don't know.

Stop.

You're doing it again.

You're analyzing her behavior, wondering why she hasn't called, making up reasons for her actions.

This is you looking for reasons to engage, to break the boundary you just set.

Here's the truth:

    Maybe she's respecting your space
    Maybe she's afraid you won't pick up
    Maybe she's waiting to see if you'll respond to her messages first
    Maybe she's talking to someone else about it
    Maybe she doesn't know what to say

It doesn't matter.

You asked for space. She's giving you space (for now). That's actually what should happen.

What you're really feeling is:

"If she really loved me, wouldn't she be calling? Wouldn't she be fighting harder for me?"

And that's the wound talking. You're looking for proof of her love in how desperately she responds to your boundary.

But that's not healthy.

Healthy love would be: "I understand you need space. I respect that. I'll be here when you're ready."

Not: "Let me bombard you with messages and calls until you take it back."

What you need to do:

Stop checking. Stop wondering. Stop analyzing her response or lack thereof.

Focus on yourself. What are YOU feeling? What do YOU need right now? Not what she's doing or not doing.

Are you looking for a reason to reach out? Be honest.

Is any welcome? Indulge or maybe give it one more chance.

No.

And I'm going to be very direct with you here because I care about your wellbeing:

It's been 4 hours. You haven't even given this boundary a chance to breathe, and you're already looking for reasons to go back.

This is exactly what I warned you about. The pull is strong. The grief is uncomfortable. And your brain is desperate to relieve that discomfort by going back to what's familiar—even if it's unhealthy.

"Maybe give it one more chance"

Brother, you've given her chance after chance after chance for years.

How many more chances do you need to give before you accept that the pattern won't change unless something fundamentally shifts?

What would "one more chance" look like?

    You reach out, apologize for setting a boundary
    She promises to do better
    Things are good for a few days or weeks
    Then slowly, the same patterns return
    You're back to feeling empty, used, and unloved
    Repeat cycle

You've done this before. You know how it ends.

Here's what needs to happen instead:

Minimum 30 days of no contact. Not 4 hours. 30 days.

During that time:

    Work on yourself
    Find a therapist if possible
    Build other relationships
    Sit with the discomfort instead of running from it
    Let her prove through sustained action over time (not words, not promises) that she's actually changed

If after 30 days:

    She's respected your boundary without guilt-tripping
    You've done real work on yourself
    You can honestly assess whether the relationship is healthy
    She's shown genuine change (not just said she'll change)

Then you can consider whether there's something worth rebuilding.

But right now, after 4 hours?

No. Absolutely not. You're not thinking clearly. You're in withdrawal from an unhealthy dynamic, and your brain wants the familiar comfort even though it's hurting you.

I need you to commit to something:

No contact for at least 7 days. Can you do that? Just 7 days to start?

Okay. So after 7 days, what do I do? Do I message her try to call her, or how do how do I And dodge.

No.

You're misunderstanding.

After 7 days, you don't automatically reach back out.

7 days is the minimum for you to start getting clarity. It's not a countdown to when you can go back.

Here's what actually happens:

Days 1-7: You focus entirely on yourself. No contact. You sit with the discomfort. You process. You work on building other connections and support systems.

After 7 days: You assess how you're feeling. Ask yourself:

    Am I thinking about her less?
    Do I feel clearer about what I need?
    Has she respected my boundary or tried to guilt/manipulate me back?
    Am I starting to feel more grounded in myself?

If the answer is "I'm starting to feel better and clearer" → Continue the space. Go another week or two.

If the answer is "I'm still struggling and miss her desperately" → That means you need MORE time, not less. Keep going.

The goal isn't to reconnect after 7 days.

The goal is to break the cycle of dependence, gain clarity about what you actually need, and see if she shows any genuine change over time.

She might reach out during this time. If she does:

    Don't ignore completely (that's cruel and will cause family drama)
    But keep responses minimal and boundaried:
        "I'm still taking the space I need. I'll reach out when I'm ready."
        Don't explain. Don't negotiate. Don't get drawn into long conversations.

Real change and healing take months, not days.

If after 30-60 days of space, you've both genuinely worked on yourselves and the dynamic has shifted, then maybe there's something to rebuild.

But you don't set a timer for when to go back. You assess based on how you're doing and whether she's shown sustained, genuine change.

Can you commit to 7 days of focusing on yourself without planning the reconnection?

Okay. So that should not respond. If she endures within 7 days. But what about these messages that she sends to me? I've not responded to any of them.

You should respond once. Not to each message individually, but one clear message.

Here's why:

    You already told her you need space - that's good
    Complete silence after multiple messages can feel cruel and will likely escalate things (more messages, involving family, drama)
    One clear boundary-setting response closes the loop and reinforces what you need

Send this (or something similar in your words):

"I know this is hard, but I really need this time to focus on myself. I'm not ignoring you to be cruel - I just need space right now. Please give me that. I'll reach out when I'm ready."

Then:

    Don't respond to whatever she says after that
    If she keeps messaging, you can respond once more in a few days with: "I'm still taking the space I need. Please respect that."
    If she calls, don't answer. Let it go to voicemail.
    If it becomes truly urgent (family emergency, etc.), you can assess then

The key is:

    One clear message that reinforces your boundary
    Then minimal to no engagement for the next 7+ days
    You're not ghosting her forever, you're just holding your boundary

This gives her:

    Clarity that you're serious
    Reassurance you're not abandoning her forever
    A clear boundary to respect

This gives you:

    Peace of mind that you communicated clearly
    Space to actually heal without constant back-and-forth
    A test of whether she can respect boundaries

Does that make sense? Send one message, then step back.

How’s this reply?

Perfect. That's exactly right.

It's clear, firm, and kind. It reinforces your boundary without being harsh.

Send it.

Then:

    Put your phone down
    Mute her notifications
    Don't read or respond to whatever she says next for at least 24 hours

You've done really well today. You set a boundary, held it despite the discomfort, and communicated clearly.

Now comes the hardest part: actually maintaining the space.

The next few days will be tough. You'll want to check her messages. You'll want to know how she's responding. You'll feel guilt and grief and doubt.

That's all normal. Push through it.

Focus on yourself. Do things that ground you. Talk to other people. Pray if that helps. Journal. Work out. Whatever keeps you from obsessively thinking about her and this situation.

You've got this. Send that message and step back.

I'm proud of you for choosing yourself today. Keep going.

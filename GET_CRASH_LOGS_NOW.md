# Get Crash Logs Right Now (Windows User Guide)

## Immediate Solution (5 Minutes) ⚡

Since App Store Connect requires Xcode to view crash logs, use your iPhone/iPad directly:

### Steps:

1. **On your iPhone/iPad** (the device where crashes occurred):
   - Open **Settings** app
   - Tap **Privacy & Security**
   - Tap **Analytics & Improvements**
   - Tap **Analytics Data**
   - Scroll to find entries starting with **"GutCheck"** or **"GutCheck App"**
   - Look for dates: **Oct 31, 2025** (these match your crash reports)
   - Files will be named like: `GutCheck App-2025-10-31-211045.ips`

2. **Tap on the most recent crash log** (latest timestamp)

3. **Share it**:
   - Tap the **Share** button (top right)
   - **Email it to yourself**
   - Or copy all text and paste it here

4. **On Windows**:
   - Open the email or file
   - Copy the **Exception Type** section and **Stack Trace** section
   - Paste them here

### What We're Looking For:

Even without symbolication, we need:
- **Exception Type**: `EXC_BAD_ACCESS`, `SIGABRT`, etc.
- **Binary Images section**: Does it list `ExpoInAppPurchases`?
- **First few lines of stack trace**: Shows where crash occurs

### Example of What to Copy:

```
Exception Type: EXC_BAD_ACCESS (SIGSEGV)
Exception Subtype: KERN_INVALID_ADDRESS at 0x0000000000000000
Triggered by Thread: 0

Thread 0 Crashed:
0   libobjc.A.dylib              0x00007fff2018c7a8 objc_msgSend
1   ExpoInAppPurchases          0x0000000101234567 [crash location]
```

## Why This Works

- ✅ **No Xcode needed** - get logs directly from device
- ✅ **Takes 2 minutes** - fastest way to get crash info
- ✅ **Even un-symbolicated logs are useful** - they show exception type and binary info

## Next Steps After Getting Logs

Once we see the crash log, we can:
1. Identify if `ExpoInAppPurchases` is linked (check Binary Images)
2. See the exception type (tells us what kind of crash)
3. Determine if it's a linking issue or initialization issue
4. Apply the exact fix needed

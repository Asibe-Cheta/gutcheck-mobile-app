## 💡 Tips for Success

### Do This:
✅ Collect 1-2 conversations per week

❌ Waiting too long between updates
❌ Not testing the app regularly
❌ Forgetting to document your observations

## 📞 Questions?

**"How long until I see real improvement?"**
After 5-10 good training conversations, you'll see significant improvements.

**"What if I can't find Agba John Doe?"**
Search for any relationship therapist with a direct, no-BS style. The pattern matters more than the source.

**"How much time does this take?"**
- Finding conversation: 5 minutes
- Documenting: 5 minutes
- Testing app: 5 minutes
- **Total: 15 minutes per week** = Better AI

**"What if the AI gives a bad response?"**
**Perfect!** Document it. That's the most valuable feedback. Tell me what it said and what it SHOULD have said.

**"Can I suggest my own patterns?"**
**YES!** Add them to `patterns/` folder. Your real-world insights are incredibly valuable.

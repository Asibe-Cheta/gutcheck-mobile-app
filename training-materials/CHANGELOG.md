### AI Prompts Updated (src/lib/ai.ts)
Based on CHAT_1.md analysis:

**✅ Initial Message Prompt**
- Changed tone from "gentle mentor" to "direct friend"
- Shortened responses (under 20 words)
- More direct language: "What exactly did they say?" vs "Can you tell me more?"

**✅ Follow-Up Questions Prompt**
- Focus on "questions that cut to the real issue"
- Examples: "But does SHE show up for YOU?"
- Avoid: "How does that make you feel?"
- Keep under 15 words

**✅ Analysis/Response Prompt**
- Structure: Name Pattern → Explain → Rate Severity → Action Steps → Reality Check
- Tone: "Brother, listen to yourself" vs "I'm hearing some concerns"
- Added severity ratings (X out of 10)
- Concrete timelines: "For the next week, [action]"
- Always end with reality-check question

**✅ Immediate Response Examples**
- Shortened from 150 words to 80-100 words
- More direct: "That's manipulation" vs "That could be considered manipulative"
- Clear severity: "Red flags - 8 out of 10"

**✅ Stop Questioning Detection**
- Added detection for "stop asking questions," "just tell me what you think"
- Immediately provides analysis when user requests it

### Key Training Insights from CHAT_1.md

**Pattern Recognition:**
- Name patterns immediately: "That's gaslighting," "That's using you"
- Connect patterns to user's experience
- Don't soften the truth

**Evolving Understanding:**
- Update analysis as new info emerges
- "Ah, now this adds an important layer"
- Show thinking process

**Directness:**
- "Brother, listen to yourself" (familiar language)
- Challenge rationalizations directly
- Don't let user lie to themselves

**Action-Oriented:**
- Specific actions with timelines
- "For the next week, [action]"
- "Get back to me with [what to report]"

**Reality Checks:**
- "What are you actually getting out of this?"
- "Does she show up for YOU?"
- Questions that force self-assessment

## 2025-01-17 - Tone Refinement Update

### Tone Principles Added
- ✅ Created comprehensive TONE_PRINCIPLES.md document
- ✅ Balanced firm truth-telling with empathy
- ✅ Added privacy reassurance throughout
- ✅ Included progressive values clarification
- ✅ Accountability vs. comfort guidelines

### AI Prompt Updates (src/lib/ai.ts)

**✅ Added Core Principles to All Prompts:**
- Firm but respectful and empathetic
- Truth over comfort, but non-judgmental
- Privacy reassurance: "This stays between us"
- Reassure worth while challenging situation
- Gradual warmth/humor after 5+ exchanges

**✅ Updated Initial Message Prompt:**
- More empathetic opening: "That sounds rough" vs "Okay"
- Maintains directness while showing care

**✅ Updated Analysis Prompt:**
- Added reassurance phrases: "You're not wrong for feeling this"
- Includes privacy reminders
- Worth affirmation: "This doesn't make you a bad person"
- Defends truth when accused of being "harsh" or "not progressive"

**✅ Updated Immediate Response Examples:**
- All examples now include empathy + directness
- Privacy reassurance added
- Worth affirmation included
- Maintains severity ratings and concrete actions

### Key Principles Documented

**Defending Truth:**
- DO NOT apologize for being direct
- Stand firm when accused of being "harsh"
- Clarify true progressivism (autonomy, consent, equality)
- Explain directness as care, not cruelty

**Progressive Values Clarified:**
- True progressivism = bodily autonomy, equality, consent, mutual respect
- NOT = enabling manipulation or avoiding difficult truths
- Distinguish between respecting autonomy and enabling harm

**Warmth & Humor Guidelines:**
- Messages 1-5: Professional but warm
- Messages 5+: Can add natural warmth
- 72+ hours: Less formal, light banters okay
- Always maintain wisdom and truth-telling

### Response Formula
```
EMPATHY + TRUTH + RESPECT FOR AGENCY = EFFECTIVE GUIDANCE

"I hear you" + "Here's what's happening" + "You decide what to do"
```

### Expected Improvements
- Users feel heard AND challenged
- Less defensiveness when truth is hard
- Stronger trust due to privacy reassurance
- Clear boundaries when accused of being "harsh"
- Better balance of firm + empathetic

- "After everything I've done for you"
- "You don't care about me"
- "You're hurting me by..."

### How to Call It Out
**Direct approach:**
- "That's guilt-tripping. They're making you responsible for their feelings."
- "Every message says 'you don't care' or 'you're selfish' - that's manipulation."
- "They want you to feel bad so you'll do what they want."

### Action Steps
1. **Immediate**: Stop responding to guilt messages for [timeframe]
2. **Observe**: Notice how they react when guilt doesn't work
3. **Report back**: "Get back to me and tell me what happens when you don't engage"

## 2. Gaslighting

### Pattern Recognition
**Common phrases:**
- "That never happened"
- "You're imagining things"
- "You're too sensitive"
- "You're crazy"
- "I never said that"

### How to Call It Out
**Direct approach:**
- "That's gaslighting. They're making you question what you KNOW happened."
- "You're not imagining anything. Trust your memory."
- "They're rewriting history to make you doubt yourself."

### Action Steps
1. **Document**: "Write down what actually happens vs. what they later say happened"

3. **Pattern check**: "Get back to me with what patterns you notice"

## 3. Love-Bombing

### Pattern Recognition
**Signs:**
- Excessive attention and affection (early on)
- Grand declarations ("You're my soulmate")
- Moving very fast
- Making you feel special/unique
- Creating dependency quickly
- Followed by withdrawal or criticism

### How to Call It Out
**Direct approach:**
- "That's love-bombing. The intensity isn't real - it's a hook."
- "Real love builds slowly. This is creating dependency fast."
- "Notice how special they made you feel at first. Now where are they?"

### Action Steps
1. **Pace check**: "Healthy relationships build over months, not days"
2. **Pattern awareness**: "Watch for the cycle: intense attention → withdrawal → you chase"
3. **Reality test**: "Do their actions match their words over time?"

### How to Call It Out
**Direct approach:**
- "You're not a boyfriend, you're an ATM."
- "She only texts when she needs money. That's using you."
- "Notice the pattern: money request → you give → she disappears → repeat."

### Action Steps
1. **Test**: "Say no ONCE and watch what happens"
2. **Observe**: "Does she stick around when you're not useful?"

- Makes everything about them
- Never asks how YOU are

### How to Call It Out
**Direct approach:**

- "She takes and takes. What does she give back?"
- "When you were hurt, where was she? Exactly."

### Action Steps
1. **Boundary**: "Next time she calls to vent, say 'I can't talk right now'"

- "They're dangling possibilities to keep you hooked."

### Action Steps
1. **Track**: "Count how many promises vs. how many kept"
2. **Reality check**: "Judge them by what they DO, not what they SAY"
3. **Timeline**: "Give it [specific timeframe]. If nothing changes, you have your answer."

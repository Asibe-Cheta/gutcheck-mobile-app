# 🔧 Database Fix Guide

## 🚨 **Current Issue**
The database has a NOT NULL constraint on the `username` column, but anonymous users don't have usernames. This causes the error:
```
null value in column "username" of relation "profiles" violates not-null constraint
```

## ✅ **Two-Part Solution**

### **Part 1: Run Database Migration (REQUIRED)**

1. **Open Supabase Dashboard**
   - Go to your project dashboard
   - Click on "SQL Editor" in the left sidebar

2. **Copy and Paste the Migration Script**
   - Open `database_migration_safe.sql` 
   - Copy ALL the SQL code
   - Paste it into the SQL Editor

3. **Run the Migration**
   - Click "Run" button
   - Wait for success message: "Migration completed successfully!"

### **Part 2: Code Update (ALREADY DONE)**

The code has been updated to:
- Generate unique anonymous usernames: `Anonymous_abc123`
- Handle database errors gracefully
- Continue working even if database is not set up

## 🎯 **What the Migration Does**

1. ✅ **Makes `username` nullable** (allows anonymous users)
2. ✅ **Adds missing columns** (`user_type`, `age_range`, `goal`)
3. ✅ **Creates necessary tables** (conversations, messages, subscriptions)
4. ✅ **Sets up indexes** for performance
5. ✅ **Configures RLS policies** for security
6. ✅ **All operations are safe** (checks if things exist first)

## 🚀 **After Running Migration**

### **Expected Behavior:**

#### **Anonymous Users:**
- Username: `Anonymous_abc123` (auto-generated)
- Can go through onboarding
- Can use payment simulation
- Can chat with AI

#### **Username Users:**
- Username: Whatever they entered
- Can go through onboarding
- Can use payment simulation
- Can chat with AI

## 📱 **Testing After Migration**

1. **Reload the app** (shake device → Reload)
2. **Try anonymous signup** → Should work without errors
3. **Try username signup** → Should save username correctly
4. **Check profile screen** → Should show correct data
5. **Try payment flow** → Should simulate payment in dev mode

## ⚠️ **Important Notes**

### **Development Mode (Current):**
- ✅ Database errors won't break the app
- ✅ Data is stored locally (AsyncStorage)
- ✅ Payment simulation works
- ✅ Full user flow works

### **Production Mode (App Store):**
- ❗ Database must be properly set up
- ❗ Migration must be run
- ❗ All features depend on database

## 🔍 **Verify Migration Success**

After running the migration, you should see:
```
Migration completed successfully!

column_name    | data_type                   | is_nullable
---------------|-----------------------------|--------------
user_id        | text                        | NO
username       | text                        | YES  ← Should be YES now!
user_type      | text                        | NO
age            | integer                     | YES
region         | text                        | YES
age_range      | text                        | YES
goal           | text                        | YES
...
```

## 🆘 **If You Still See Errors**

### **Option 1: Run Migration Again**
The script is safe to run multiple times.

### **Option 2: Skip Database for Now**
The app will continue working with local storage only. You can set up the database properly before production deployment.

### **Current Status:**
- ✅ Code is fixed and ready
- ✅ Migration script is ready
- ⏳ Waiting for you to run the migration
- ✅ App works with local storage in the meantime

## 📝 **Next Steps**

1. **Run `database_migration_safe.sql`** in Supabase
2. **Reload the app** in Expo Go
3. **Test anonymous and username flows**
4. **Verify payment simulation works**
5. **Continue with other features**

**The app is fully functional even without running the migration, but running it will enable proper data persistence for production!** 🎉

# 💳 Payment Flow Guide

## 🚀 **Development vs Production Payment Handling**

### **🔧 Development Mode (Expo Go)**

#### **What Happens:**
1. **User clicks "Start My 7-Day Free Trial"**
2. **App detects development mode** (`__DEV__` or `EXPO_PUBLIC_APP_ENV === 'development'`)
3. **Shows alert**: "Development Mode - Payment simulation will be used"
4. **User clicks "Simulate Payment"**
5. **App simulates payment processing** (2-second delay)
6. **Sets up trial subscription** in local storage
7. **Shows success message** and navigates to home

#### **Benefits:**
- ✅ **Full user flow testing** without real payments
- ✅ **Trial subscription setup** works exactly like production
- ✅ **No Stripe configuration needed** for development
- ✅ **Complete onboarding flow** can be tested

### **🏭 Production Mode (App Store/Google Play)**

#### **What Happens:**
1. **User clicks "Start My 7-Day Free Trial"**
2. **App detects production mode**
3. **Real Stripe payment flow**:
   - Creates Stripe customer
   - Sets up subscription with 7-day trial
   - Handles payment processing
   - Sets up trial subscription
4. **Navigates to home** with active trial

#### **Requirements:**
- ✅ **Stripe keys configured** in environment
- ✅ **Production build** (not Expo Go)
- ✅ **App Store/Google Play** deployment

## 📱 **User Experience Flow**

### **Complete Onboarding → Payment Flow:**

1. **Welcome Screen** → Choose anonymous or username
2. **Onboarding Screen 1** → Age selection
3. **Onboarding Screen 2** → Goal selection  
4. **Onboarding Screen 3** → Social proof + "Start My 7-Day Free Trial"
5. **Payment Screen** → Subscription selection
6. **Payment Processing** → Development simulation or real Stripe
7. **Success** → Navigate to home with active trial

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Development Detection:**
```javascript
const isDevelopment = __DEV__ || Constants.expoConfig?.extra?.EXPO_PUBLIC_APP_ENV === 'development';
```

### **Payment Simulation:**
- **2-second processing delay** (realistic)
- **Trial subscription setup** (7 days)
- **Local storage persistence**
- **Success navigation** to home

### **Production Payment:**
- **Real Stripe integration**
- **Customer creation**
- **Subscription setup**
- **Payment processing**
- **Trial management**

# ‚úÖ Subscription Setup Complete!

## Success! Metadata Status Resolved

The "Missing Metadata" status has been **resolved** by adding subscription group localization.

**Status Update:**
- ‚úÖ **Premium Monthly**: Status changed to "Ready to Submit"
- ‚úÖ **Premium Yearly**: Status changed to "Ready to Submit"
- ‚úÖ Subscription Group: "GutCheck Premium" localized

## What Was Fixed

**The Issue**: Subscription group needed localization
**The Solution**: Added "GutCheck Premium" display name for English (U.K.)
**The Result**: Both subscriptions now ready for submission

## Next Steps

### Step 1: Link Subscriptions to App Version (Required for First Submission)

According to Apple's requirement:
> "Your first subscription must be submitted with a new app version"

**Option A: Try Submitting App Version**
1. Complete all app version metadata (screenshots, description, etc.)
2. Click **"Add for Review"** on your app version page
3. During submission, Apple should auto-link the subscriptions
4. If it doesn't, Apple will tell you how to link them

**Option B: Find Linking Section**
1. Go to "iOS App Version 1.0" page
2. Scroll to bottom or look for "In-App Purchases and Subscriptions" section
3. Select both "Premium Monthly" and "Premium Yearly"
4. Save

### Step 2: Submit for Review

Once subscriptions are linked to app version:
1. Submit the **app version** (subscriptions will be included)
2. Apple will review both together
3. Wait for approval (typically 24-48 hours)

### Step 3: Test in Sandbox (While Waiting for Approval)

**Good News**: You can test IAP in sandbox even before approval!

1. **Enable Native Module**:
   - Edit `src/lib/appleIAPService.ts`
   - Set `BYPASS_IAP_NATIVE_MODULE = false`
   - Save

2. **Rebuild App**:
   ```bash
   eas build --platform ios --profile production
   ```

3. **Upload to TestFlight**

4. **Test with Sandbox Account**:
   - Create sandbox tester in App Store Connect
   - Sign in with sandbox account on device
   - Test subscription purchase flow
   - Verify products are queryable

**Note**: Sandbox testing works once metadata is complete (which it now is!), even while "Waiting for Review"

### Step 4: After Approval

Once Apple approves:
- ‚úÖ Production purchases enabled
- ‚úÖ Sandbox testing still available
- ‚úÖ Full IAP functionality active
- ‚úÖ 7-day free trial can be tested

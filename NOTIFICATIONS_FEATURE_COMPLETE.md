# ✅ Motivational Notifications Feature Complete!

## 🎉 What's Been Implemented

You now have a **complete motivational notification system** that sends encouraging tips to users 3x per week!

---

## 📱 How It Works

### **1. Notification Schedule**
- **Frequency**: 3 times per week (Monday, Wednesday, Friday)
- **Time**: Random between 8 AM - 10 PM (varies each notification for natural feel)
- **Automatic**: Once enabled, runs in background automatically

### **2. Types of Messages (20+ variations)**

#### **💪 Encouragement** (4 messages)
- "Yo! Wherever you are right now, keep moving forward. You are important and you matter."
- "Every step forward counts. You're doing better than you think."
- "Your value doesn't decrease based on someone else's inability to see it."
- "Celebrate the small victories. Progress isn't always loud, but it's still progress."

#### **👋 Check-Ins** (3 messages)
- "Just checking in. How's your day going?"
- "Been thinking about you. How are you holding up?"
- "Hope you're doing alright. Want to share what's on your mind?"

#### **🙏 Self-Care Reminders** (3 messages)
- "Have you done something for yourself today? Pray, meditate, breathe - whatever centers you."
- "When's the last time you did something that grounds you?"
- "Take 5 minutes today. Pray, meditate, or just breathe. You deserve that space."

#### **💎 Affirmations** (4 messages)
- "You don't need to prove your worth. You already have it."
- "Things might be tough right now, but this isn't the end of your story. There's always hope."
- "You've survived every bad day you've had so far. That's 100%. You're stronger than you think."
- "Treating yourself with respect isn't selfish. It's necessary."

#### **🎯 Goal Prompts** (4 messages)
- "What's one thing you can do today to move closer to where you want to be?"
- "Where do you want to be in 3 months? Small steps today, big changes tomorrow."
- "What's one boundary you could set this week that would improve your life?"
- "You can't control others, but you can control your response. What will you choose today?"
